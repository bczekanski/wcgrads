HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE
The chartering of Williams College in 1793 was an act of faith and certainly an act surpassing the modest intentions of Colonel Ephraim
Williams, for whom the college is named.
Colonel Williams had not intended to found a college. Enroute with his regiment of Massachusetts militia to join the battle with the French
and Indians at Lake George, the Colonel had tarried long enough in Albany to write his last will and testament on July 22, 1755. In it he
bequeathed his residuary estate for the founding and support of a free school in West Township, where for some years he had commanded a
detachment of militia at Fort Massachusetts, farthest outpost of the province. The will stipulated that West Township, then in dispute between
Massachusetts and New York, must fall within Massachusetts and that the name of the township must be changed to Williamstown, if the free
school was to be established at all.
On September 8, 1755, Colonel Williams was killed at the Battle of Lake George. On October 26, 1791, after many delays, fifteen scholars
were admitted to the free school in Williamstown. Within a year the trustees, not content with the original modest design of the founder, were
captivated by the idea of creating a college where, as they put it, "young gentlemen from every part of the Union" might resort for instruction " in
all the branches of useful and polite literature." The proposal was extremely ambitious, to be sure, but ambition was a common American ail-
ment. England did not develop a third university until the nineteenth century; Williams was the twenty-first institution of higher learning to
flower in onetime British colonies, the second in Massachusetts, the sixth in New England. On June 22, 1793, the Commonwealth of Massachu-
setts granted a charter to Williams College.
I
The bold decision to plant a college in the wilderness betrayed the intentions of Colonel Williams; yet the new vision had been fed by the
same sort of dreams that had led Ephraim Williams to see a school and a comfortable community where only a military outpost had stood.
The early trustees and the legislature of the Commonwealth were to be remembered for their foresight, but in the decades after 1793 they had
reason to acknowledge that the soil they had chosen was stubbornly uncongenial--so uncongenial, in fact, that for many years the trustees of
Williams spent more time and energy in trying to close the College than in trying to keep it open.
In 1819 they petitioned to move the college to Northhampton, and in 1821, having been spurned by the legislature, President Zephaniah Swift
Moore took matters into his own hands. Convinced that almost everything about Williams was impossible--its location, its funds, its enroll-
ment--he led a group of students over the mountains into the Connecticut Valley. There he became their president once again, at the struggling
new college known as Amherst. As for Williams, one member of the senior class wrote home to his father: "It remains for us to say whether it
shall die suddenly, or whether it shall linger along for two or three years."
In the past the public had come to the support of the institution. A lottery furnished funds essential to the opening of the free school. A
public subscription was the answer of Berkshire County to the threat of removal in 1819. What saved the College in 1821 was the willingness
of the Reverend Edward Dorr Griffin to take the job of president and the determination with which he drew upon the College's reputation for
religious conservatism to collect much-needed funds. By 1828, the Reverend Griffin could be seen standing in the middle of Main Street,
supervising the construction of a handsome new building, housing a chapel, a library, and classrooms, a testament to his confidence and his
skill. The building is now known as Griffin Hall.
The College which had been taking shape under Griffin and his predecessors was not unlike many other New England colleges where the
classical curriculum and a moral atmosphere served as the basis for training young men for professional life. The college turned out its share
of clergymen, doctors, lawyers, and teachers, serving the needs of Western Massachusetts and surrounding communities in New York and
Vermont. But Williams was not yet a place to which "young gentlemen from every part of the Union" resorted. In fact, Nathaniel Hawthorne,
attending the commencement exercises in 1838, jotted in his notebook some observations on the Williams students he saw there: "Country
graduates--rough, brown-featured, schoolmaster-looking...A rough hewn, heavy set of fellows from the hills and woods in this neighbor-
hood; unpolished bumpkins, who had grown up as farmer-boys."
Williams seldom knew financial security until the end of the nineteenth century. But it did have assets that enabled it to develop into a
prototype of the small New England liberal arts college. Scenery, a reputation for moral soundness, a loyal body of alumni, and a devoted
faculty went a long way toward compensating for inadequate funds.
Of the scenery, Thoreau remarked, after a visit in 1844, "It would be no small advantage if every college were thus located at the base of a
mountain." For Thoreau the location of Williams was "as good at least as one well-endowed professorship."
In the early years the religious reputation of the College depended on the essential orthodoxy of its presidents and faculty. It gathered
strength from the famous episode of the "haystack meeting" in the summer of 1806. Five Williams undergraduates, seeking to continue their
prayers and conversations in spite of a sudden thunderstorm, retired from a grove of trees to the shelter of a nearby haystack, where they were
inspired to launch the great adventure of American foreign missions. The extremely informal ties with the Congregationalists saved it from
the sometimes stifling stranglehold of an organic denominational connection.
During a crisis in the affairs of the College in 1821, a group of alumni met in Williamstown and organized the Society of Alumni, dedicated to
the future welfare of the College. Their action gave Williams the distinction of organizing the first college alumni society in history. Alumni
loyalty was rewarded when, in 1868, the College provided for official alumni representation on the board of trustees, an act of recognition in
which only Harvard, among American colleges, anticipated Williams.
II
But essentially the College has built its reputation around teachers and teaching. Mark Hopkins, who was a Williams professor from 1830 to
1887 and president of the College from 1836 to 1872, has become a symbol of this emphasis. In American education Hopkins pioneered in
making the student the center of the educational experience, and he did it so well that one of his former students, U.S. President James A. Gar-
field, immortalized his achievement in an aphorism which has passed into the lore of American education: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins
on one end of a log and a student on the other." The Hopkins tradition has become one of the College's great assets. It has been perpetuated in the
lives of generations of teachers.
Scenery, a reputation for building sound character, loyal but not especially affluent alumni, and devoted teachers could keep the College
open, but like most other colleges Williams did not experience growth and prosperity until the closing decades of the nineteenth century. The
scenery, of course, remained constant, but it developed into an even greater asset as the United States became more urbanized and industrial-
ized. Williams was still a country college; a Massachusetts court decision of 1888 declared that cows owned by the college were tax exempt.
The discovery that businessmen could profit from liberal education sent college enrollments upward as the century drew to a close; now
more Williams alumni were men of affairs, fewer were clergymen. By 1906, of all the colleges in New England, Williams drew the largest
percentage of students from outside New England.
From 1793 through 1870 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts appropriated for Williams College over $150,000, a sum of such importance
that Mark Hopkins himself observed that he did "not see how the College could have got on" without state aid. A new and more dependable
source of financial support was developed as the century drew to a close. In the 1890's Frederick Ferris Thompson of the Class of 1856 became
4
the first of many individuals to supersede the Commonwealth as the largest benefactor of the College. Ephraim Williams' original bequest of
$9,297 has since grown by additional gifts and bequests to an endowment valued at approximately $1.3 billion.
III
Williams moved into the twentieth century firm in its intentions to remain a college, at a time when aspirations toward university status were
unsettling many of the old colleges. It adhered to a curriculum that was designed for undergraduates; it made room for the elective principle, but
it subjected course election to safeguards and controls. The idea of a liberally educated man was not jettisoned in favor of the widely accepted
idea of almost complete student freedom in course election. A survey of the college curriculum in 1925 showed that Williams had combined the
principles of prescription and election, the goals of concentration and distribution, in such a way as to be the only major American college
without any absolutely required courses and without any uncontrolled wide-option electives. The Williams curriculum has continued to evolve,
but it has not undergone such a series of major overhauls as characterize curriculums inspired by the popular educational fancy of the moment.
Not having abandoned itself to the elective principle in the nineteenth century, Williams did not need to rescue itself with the general education
principle of the twentieth century.
During its long history much of the life and tone of the college was shaped by students. While the same influence continues, the competi-
tive pressure for admission since World War II has allowed for a new and significant degree of selectivity on the part of the College. Among
the consequences of this change have been a quickening of the intellectual life of the College and a reconsideration of traditions and em-
phases no longer considered appropriate for an institution of liberal learning.
Among the first traditions to go was compulsory religious exercises, abandoned in 1962 after a hundred years of gradual but steady ero-
sion. Voluntary worship in the form of ecumenical chapel services and the activities of student religious organizations carry on another long
tradition. In response to the concern of undergraduate leaders and the faculty and in recognition of the failure of Greek Letter Fraternities to
fulfill adequately objectives consistent with college purpose, the Trustees in 1962 took the first of a series of actions that replaced fraternities
with a residential house system. Williams became, as a result, a much more open community. The decision to become coeducational and the
admission of women to Williams as degree candidates in 1970 have reinforced the spirit of equality and freedom conducive to a climate of
learning.
In this atmosphere of change and heightened purpose the curriculum underwent appropriate transformations, as a careful comparative
study of the yearly catalogues readily shows, leading to the present 4-1-4 curriculum and a more flexible and wide-ranging schedule and
program both on and beyond the campus. Changes in the curriculum included the addition of majors and the introduction of interdisciplinary
programs, along with the expansion of language offerings to include full, four-year cycles in Chinese and Japanese. Continuing the tradition
of putting the student at the center of the educational experience, Williams in the Fall of 1988 introduced in each department at least one
course taught as a tutorial, in which, typically, pairs of students meet weekly with the professor to discuss a paper, problem set, or work of art
produced by one of the students. By 1992 some 40 percent of the graduating class had experienced at least one tutorial course either in Wil-
liamstown or in the Williams-Oxford program, run in association with Exeter College, Oxford, which provides each year for some 30 Wil-
liams juniors a year-long immersion in the life of Oxford University.
This curricular expansion reflected, and in part resulted from, the fact that the makeup of the college community was changing to mirror
more closely the growing racial, ethnic, and religious diversity of American society. The percentage of Williams students who identified
themselves as members of one or more American minority group rose to 25 percent; of faculty almost 13 percent.
At the beginning of this decade, President Morton Owen Schapiro inaugurated a strategic planning process, through which the College
community identified priorities for change in the curriculum and in residential life. The size of the faculty is being expanded to provide more
curricular opportunities for students in tutorials and experiential learning. Requirements have been added in intensive writing instruction
and in quantitative and formal reasoning. New programming and structures are being added to student residential life and major projects
have been undertaken to greatly enhance the College's student center, its facilities for theatre and dance, and its office and teaching spaces for
faculty.
5
MISSION AND PURPOSES
Williams seeks to provide the finest possible liberal arts education by nurturing in students the academic and civic virtues, and their related
traits of character. Academic virtues include the capacities to explore widely and deeply, think critically, reason empirically, express clearly, and
connect ideas creatively. Civic virtues include commitment to engage both the broad public realm and community life, and the skills to do so
effectively. These virtues, in turn, have associated traits of character. For example, free inquiry requires open-mindedness, and commitment to
community draws on concern for others.
We are committed to our central endeavor of academic excellence in a community of learning that comprises students, faculty, and staff, and
draws on the engagement of alumni and parents. We recruit students from among the most able in the country and abroad and select them for the
academic and personal attributes they can contribute to the educational enterprise, inside and outside the classroom. Our faculty is a highly
talented group of teachers, scholars, and artists committed deeply to the education of our students and to involving them in their efforts to expand
human knowledge and understanding through original research, thought, and artistic expression. Dedicated staff enable this teaching and learn-
ing to take place at the highest possible level, as does the involvement and support of our extraordinarily loyal parents and alumni.
No one can pretend to more than guess at what students now entering college will be called upon to comprehend in the decades ahead. No
training in fixed techniques, no finite knowledge now at hand, no rigid formula can solve problems whose shape we cannot yet define. The most
versatile, the most durable, in an ultimate sense, the most practical knowledge and intellectual resources that we can offer students are the open-
ness, creativity, flexibility, and power of education in the liberal arts.
Toward that end we extend a curriculum that offers wide opportunities for learning, ensures close attention of faculty to students but also
encourages students to learn independently, and reflects the complexity and diversity of the world. We seek to do this in an atmosphere that
nurtures the simple joy of learning as a lifelong habit and commitment.
We place great emphasis on the learning that takes place in the creation of a functioning community: life in the residence halls, expression
through the arts, debates on political issues, leadership in campus governance, exploration of personal identity, pursuit of spiritual and religious
impulses, the challenge of athletics, and direct engagement with human needs, nearby and far away.
To serve well our students and the world, Williams embraces core values such as welcoming and supporting in the College community people
from all segments of our increasingly diverse society and ensuring that College operations are environmentally sustainable.
From this holistic immersion students learn more than they will ever know. Such is the testimony of countless graduates--that their Williams
experience has equipped them to live fuller, more effective lives. Ultimately, the College's greatest mark on the world consists of this: the
contributions our alumni make in their professions, their communities, and their personal lives.
Therefore, we ask all our students to understand that an education at Williams should not be regarded as a privilege destined to create further
privilege, but as a privilege that creates opportunities to serve society at large, and imposes the responsibility to do so.
At the same time, being itself privileged by its history and circumstances, Williams understands its own responsibility to contribute by
thought and example to the world of higher education.
The above description arises on its surface from public statements made by Williams presidents and others associated with the College, from
which it borrows, and at a deeper level from the felt experience of students, faculty, staff, alumni, and parents over many decades. It was
approved by vote of the Board of Trustees on April 14, 2007.

THE CURRICULUM
Williams College offers a course of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The course requirements prescribe both the number of
courses to be completed and the minimum grade level to be achieved; the curriculum also requires that each student explore several fields of
knowledge and concentrate in one. The full requirements for the degree include meeting the minimum academic standards stated below,
residing at the College, fulfilling the distribution requirement, completing a major, and completing the physical education requirement.
The academic year is divided into two regular semesters and a Winter Study Period. The student takes four courses in each semester and
during January pursues a single program of study on a pass-fail basis.
Winter Study Period, which began in 1967, is intended to provide students and faculty with a dramatically different educational experi-
ence. The differences are in the nature of the courses, the nature of the learning experience, and the change of educational pace and format
from the fall and spring semesters. These differences apply to the faculty and students in several ways: faculty can try out courses with new
subjects and techniques that might, if successful, be used later in the regular terms; they can explore subjects not amenable to inclusion in
regular courses; and they can investigate fields outside their usual areas of expertise. In their academic work, which is graded Honors, Pass,
Perfunctory Pass, or Fail, students can explore new fields at low risk, concentrate on one subject that requires a great deal of time, develop
individual research projects, or work in a different milieu (as interns, for example, or on trips outside Williamstown). In addition, Winter
Study offers studentsan opportunity formore independence and initiativeinaless formalsetting, more opportunity to participate in cultural
events, and an occasion to get to know one another better.
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACHELOR OF ARTS DEGREE
Academic Requirement
To be eligible for the Bachelor of Arts degree a student must pass 32 regularly graded semester courses and receive grades of C minus or
higher in at least 19 of those semester courses, pass four Winter Study Projects, fulfill the four-part distribution requirement, complete all
requirements for the major including an average of C minus or higher, and complete the physical education requirement. A student may not
repeat a course for which degree credit has been awarded.
Distribution Requirement
The distribution requirement falls into four parts. Please note that courses used to fulfill these requirements must be regu-
larly graded.
1) DIVISIONAL REQUIREMENT--designed to ensure that in their course of study at Williams, students take an appropriately diverse distribution of
courses across the full range of the curriculum.
For the purposes of the requirement, courses are grouped into three divisions: Division I, Languages and the Arts; Division II, Social Studies; and Division
III, Science and Mathematics. A full listing of the subjects in each division appears below.
Students must complete at least three graded semester courses in each division. Two in each division must be completed by the end of the sophomore year.
No more than two of the courses used to satisfy the requirement may have the same course prefix. The courses must be taken at Williams or at programs
under the direction of Williams College Faculty.
Courses that fulfill the distribution requirement in Division I are designed to help students become better able to respond to the arts sensitively and intelli-
gently by learning the language, whether verbal, visual, or musical, of a significant field of artistic expression. Students learn how to develop the capacity
for critical discussion, to increase awareness of the esthetic and moral issues raised by works of art, and to grow in self-awareness and creativity.
Courses which fulfill the Division II requirement consider the institutions and social structures that human beings have created, whether knowingly or
unknowingly, and which in turn markedly affect their lives. These courses are intended to help the students recognize, analyze, and evaluate these human
structures in order that they may better understand themselves and the social world in which they live.
Courses which fulfill the Division III requirement are intended to provide some of the factual and methodological knowledge needed to be an informed
citizen in a world deeply influenced by scientific thought and technological accomplishment, and to cultivate skill in exact and quantitative reasoning.

Please note: Any Environmental Studies course that is also cross-listed with another subject carries distribution credit of that subject. Other Environ-
mental Studies courses may fulfill distribution requirements as indicated under individual course listings.
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University tutorial courses (WIOX) may be used toward fulfilling the divisional distribution requirement; a
student may earn a maximum of three distribution requirements, with no more than one from each division, for the year. All tutorial courses in the
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University (WIOX) meet the Williams College `W' designation, except for those in studio arts, mathematics,
and the sciences. Courses at the Williams-Mystic Program may also be used toward fulfilling the distribution requirement as appropriate.
2) THE EXPLORING DIVERSITY INITIATIVE REQUIREMENT--Williams College is committed to creating and maintaining a curriculum, faculty,
and student body that reflects and explores a diverse, globalized world and the multi-cultural character of the United States. Courses designated "(D)" in the
College Bulletin are a part of the College's Exploring Diversity Initiative (EDI); they represent our dedication to study groups, cultures, and societies as
they interact with, and challenge, each other. Through such courses, students and faculty also consider the multiple approaches that engage these issues.
Rather than simply focus on the study of specific peoples, cultures, or regions of the world, in the past or present, however, courses fulfilling the require-
ment actively promote a self-conscious and critical engagement with diversity. They urge students to consider the operations of difference in the world and
provide them with the tools to do so. The ultimate aim of the requirement is to lay the groundwork for a life-long engagement with the diverse cultures,
societies, and histories of the United States and the rest of the world.
Courses that comprise the Exploring Diversity Initiative may fall under a variety of categories, including (but not limited to) the following:
1. Comparative Study of Cultures and Societies. These courses focus on the differences and similarities between cultures and societies, and/or on the ways in
which cultures, peoples, and societies have interacted and responded to one another in the past.
2. Empathetic Understanding. These courses explore diverse human feelings, thoughts, and actions by recreating the social, political, cultural, and historical
context of a group in order to imagine why within that context, those beliefs, experiences, and actions of the group emerged.
3. Power and Privilege: These courses link issues of diversity to economic and political power relations, investigating how cultural interaction is influenced by
various structures, institutions, or practices that enable, maintain, or mitigate inequality among different groups.
4. Critical Theorization: These courses focus on ways scholars theorize the possibilities of cross-cultural understanding and interaction; they investigate the
ways that disciplines and paradigms of knowledge both constitute "difference" and are reconfigured by the study of diversity-related questions.
5. Cultural Immersion: In various ways these courses immerse students in another culture and give them the tools with which to understand that culture from
the inside. They include those foreign language courses that explicitly engage in the self-conscious awareness of cultural and societal differences, traditions,
and customs as an integral aspect of language study.
All students are required to complete ONE course that is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative. Although this course, which may be counted toward the
divisional distribution requirement, may be completed any semester before graduation, students are urged to complete the course by the end of the sopho-
more year.
By immersing students in foreign cultures, and often by furthering language acquisition, study abroad programs can offer a robust way to study cultural
diversity. Students wishing to fulfill the EDI requirement via the completion of a study abroad program must submit a petition before departure proposing
EDI credit for a particular course on their program, for particular experiences (such as independent research or a homestay), or for a specific language
training program they will undertake while abroad. The petition will require students to describe how they believe their proposed study abroad experience
will meet one or more of the goals of the Exploring Diversity Initiative; it will be considered by the Director of the Exploring Diversity Initiative working in
concert with the Committee on Academic Standing.
The one-course EDI requirement must be met by all members of the classes of 2012 and 2013; members of the classes of 2010 and 2011 who have already
completed a course designated "People's and Cultures" do not need to complete an EDI course.
Click here for a list of courses offered in 2009-2010 that meet the requirement.
3) QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING REQUIREMENT is intended to help students become adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly.
The ability to apply a formal method to reach conclusions, to use numbers comfortably, and to employ the research tools necessary to analyze data lessen
barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to the senior year, all students must pass a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR) course--
those marked with a "(Q)." Students requiring extra assistance (as assessed during First Days) are normally placed into Mathematics 100/101/102, which is
to be taken before fulfilling the QFR requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical symbols and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate
answer. Primary evaluation in these courses is based on multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive answers). Click
here for a list of courses offered in 2009-2010 that meet the requirement.
4) WRITING REQUIREMENT--All students are required to take two writing-intensive courses: one by the end of sophomore year, and one by the end of the
junior year. Students will benefit most from the writing-intensive courses by taking them early in their college careers, and are therefore strongly encour-
aged to complete the requirement by the end of the sophomore year.
The goal of the writing-intensive course requirement is to improve student writing proficiency across disciplines. Students in these courses should expect to
receive guidance on style, argumentation, and other significant aspects of writing, as well as evaluation and criticism of their writing throughout the semes-
ter. This may be achieved through a variety of approaches: brief assignments spaced over the semester, sequenced assignments leading to a longer final
paper, etc. Writing-intensive courses may also include multiple drafts, conferences, peer review, or class discussions designed to improve writing skills. A
course with a single long paper due at the end of the semester, but with no required or structured means of addressing writing issues, would not be consid-
ered writing intensive.
Writing-intensive courses require a minimum of 20 pages of writing and have a maximum enrollment of 19 to allow the instructor to devote appropriate
attention to writing over the course of the semester.
All tutorial courses in the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University (WIOX) meet the Williams College `W' designation, except for those in the
studio arts, mathematics, and the sciences.
Click here for a list of courses offered in 2009-2010 that meet the requirement.
Major Requirement
The Major Requirement is designed to assure that all Williams undergraduates will have the experience of disciplined and cumulative study, carried on over an
extended period of time, in some important field of intellectual inquiry. Juniors are required to declare a major and the selection is normally made at the time of
registration in the spring of the sophomore year.
Majors are offered in the following fields:
American Studies History
Anthropology Japanese
Art Literary Studies
Asian Studies Mathematics
Astronomy Music
Astrophysics Philosophy
Biology Physics
Chemistry Political Economy
Chinese Political Science
Classics (Greek, Latin) Psychology
Comparative Literature Religion
Computer Science Russian
Economics Sociology
English Spanish
French Theatre
Geosciences Women's and Gender Studies
German
8
GENERAL STRUCTURE OF MAJORS
1) A student ordinarily must elect at least nine semester courses in his or her major field. A major may also require an additional course
and/or one Winter Study Project during the junior or senior year.
A student may also fulfill the minimum requirements for a major by taking eight semester courses in the major field and two semester
courses, approved by a major advisor, in associated fields. In interdepartmental majors, such as Political Economy, a larger number of
courses may be required.
2) A prescribed sequence of courses, supplemented by parallel courses, and including a major seminar, is required in some major fields.
Other majors ask the student to plan a sequence of elective courses, including advanced work building on elementary courses in the field, and
ending in a one- or two- semester faculty-organized course or project in the senior year. All majors provide a system of counseling to help
students plan programs reflecting individual interests as well as disciplined and cumulative patterns of inquiry.
Courses in many major programs require prerequisite courses in related areas. A full description of the detailed structure of each major is
found under the heading of that major.
CONTRACT MAJOR
Students who wish to undertake the coherent study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered by a regularly offered major may propose to
be contract majors. Procedures for arranging a contract major and for honors work in such a major are described in the section, "Courses of
Instruction." Students interested in this option should begin consulting with the Dean's Office and with potential faculty advisors early in the
sophomore year. A student completing a contract major may not do so in conjunction with a second major. For further details, click here
TWO MAJORS
A student may complete two majors with the permission of both majors and the Committee on Academic Standing. Although a student
may be granted permission to use a course from one major to fulfill a particular requirement in the other, the student nevertheless must take
the minimum number of courses in each field without counting any course twice. A student may be a candidate for Honors in either or both of
the majors, but a course for Honors in one major may not be used for an Honors course in the other.
Physical Education Requirement
The Physical Education requirement provides students the opportunity of establishing and maintaining a general level of fitness and well-
being; of developing abilities in carry-over activities; of discovering and extending their own physical capabilities; and of developing skills
in activities with survival implications, such as swimming.
A swim test is required of all first-year students at the start of the academic year. Students who fail to complete the test must pass a basic
swim course given in the Physical Education program during the first quarter of the year.
Students must complete four quarters of physical education by the end of the sophomore year. Students must enroll in at least two different
activities in fulfilling the requirement.
Participation in a fall or spring intercollegiate sport is equivalent to two activity units and participation in a winter sport is equivalent to
three units. A maximum of three credits may be attained while participating in intercollegiate sports with the exception of a two sport athlete
who can fulfill the physical education requirement by totaling four units in two sports. Students may receive a maximum of two activity units
for participation in a club sport; the remaining two units must come from the physical education activity program.
Residence Requirement
Students who begin college at Williams must spend a minimum of six semesters in residence at Williams. Students transferring to Wil-
liams from other institutions must spend a minimum of four semesters in residence at Williams, and those entering as sophomores are ex-
pected to spend six semesters in residence. Students are considered to be in residence if they are taking a program of study under the direction
of the Williams College Faculty. Students must be in residence for both semesters of the final year.
The degree requirements must be completed within eight semesters, including any semesters for which a student receives credit while not
in residence at Williams. Thus, semesters spent away on exchange or other approved programs at other colleges are included in the eight
semesters.
ADDITIONAL CURRICULAR OPPORTUNITIES
Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate
At the discretion of the appropriate departments or programs, students presenting satisfactory scores in Advanced Placement tests or Inter-
national Baccalaureate higher level examinations may be placed in advanced courses not regularly open to them and/or may receive course
credit toward the major or concentration. Therefore, if granted, this credit may be used as a prerequisite or in partial fulfillment of the major
or concentration requirements. AP and IB credit, however, may not be used to reduce the normal course load of any semester, to make up a
deficiency incurred at Williams, or to satisfy the Distribution Requirement.
Degree Credit Based on A-Level Examination Grades
Upon petition from the student, the Committee on Academic Standing may award two course credits toward the Williams degree for each
grade of A or B received on an A-Level Examination in a liberal arts discipline. These credits may be used to accelerate graduation but may not
be used to lower the course load during a semester in residence.
Normally, the student must have completed at least one full year of study at Williams and have met minimum academic standards before
the CAS would consider the petition. The petition must include certification that all degree requirements, including a major, can be fulfilled if
the credit is awarded.
Certificate in Foreign Languages
Certificates are awarded in Arabic, French, German, Russian and Spanish. The certificate confirms a particular degree of proficiency,
cultural literacy and experience with the language in the context of the student's college education. Seven or eight courses are required,
depending on the language. Please see the individual programs for details and specific requirements.
Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering
The 3-2 program enables qualified students to combine a liberal arts education at Williams with undergraduate professional training in
engineering. In this program, a student studies at Williams for 3 years, completing 24 courses and 3 Winter Study Projects. He or she then
transfers to a leading engineering school and studies for a Bachelor of Science degree, usually for 2 more years. Upon successful completion
of this program, the student receives a Bachelor of Arts degree from Williams and a Bachelor of Science degree from the engineering school.
During their 3 years at Williams, 3-2 students must complete all of the normal requirements for a Williams degree, including a major and
the distribution requirements. For students majoring in physics, chemistry, computer science, or mathematics, the requirements for the se-
nior year courses and major exercise are waived for the Williams degree. Only students who have taken the prerequisite courses, who have at
least a B average in scientific subjects, and who have a good record in other subjects will be recommended by their major department and
approved by the Committee on Academic Standing for this program.
The 3-2 program has an extensive list of prerequisite mathematics and science courses, so it is necessary to plan course selections at Wil-
liams carefully. The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" includes a list of Williams courses recommended to prospective engineers.
A popular alternative to the 3-2 program is to complete the Williams B.A. in the usual 4 years, majoring in one of the sciences, and then go
directly to a graduate program in engineering. Please see the section of this catalog titled "Preparation for Graduate and Professional Study."
9
Also, prospective engineers at Williams have the opportunity to take undergraduate engineering courses at other institutions through various
exchange programs. For information about these opportunities, please see the section titled "Exchange Programs."
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to assist students interested in any of the options leading to engi-
neering careers. Many more details about pre-engineering can be found in the Physics Department section of the College website.
Co-ordinate Programs Offering Concentrations
In addition to majoring in a field, a student may choose to concentrate elective courses on a single topic or area. Normally, a student de-
clares a concentration at the time of registration in the spring of the sophomore year. Concentrations are offered in the following programs:
Africana Studies
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
Cognitive Science
Environmental Studies
International Studies
Jewish Studies
Latina/o Studies
Leadership Studies
Legal Studies
Maritime Studies
Neuroscience
Science and Technology Studies
Descriptions of these programs appear under the appropriate heading in this publication. If the co-ordinate program courses are directly
related to the major, a student may be allowed to reduce the number of courses required to complete the major.
Co-ordinate Programs
A number of programs do not formally offer concentrations, but do provide students with the opportunity to work in areas that cut across
departmental and program lines. These are: Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics; History of Science; Materials Science Studies; Per-
formance Studies; and Public Health. They are listed in this publication in alphabetical order.
These programs provide guidance only and do not appear on transcripts.
The Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills (CRAAS) Initiative
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Machiavelli, or modernism--to teach intel-
lectual skills that have wide application in other fields as well as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical
analysis, oral presentation, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS class covers a different topic, all are
aimed particularly at developing the processes necessary for excellence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or
artworks; approaches to interpreting, synthesizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and revision--with the goal of constant im-
provement. Many classes feature peer tutoring, small group work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should
leave a CRAAS course with a substantially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft arguments in whatever disci-
pline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and some are specifically targeted for first-year
students. Most have strictly limited enrollment. Because these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are
encouraged to consider taking a CRAAS course early in their academic careers.
Click here for a list of CRAAS courses offered in 2009-2010.
Cross-Enrollment Programs
A limited number of students may register at Bennington College or Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts for courses not offered by
Williams. Interested students should contact the Registrar's Office about arrangements.
Experiential Education at Williams
Experiential education, involving "learning by doing" outside the classroom, has been a relatively understated but successful part of the
Williams curriculum for a number of years. In addition to the use of traditional laboratory work in the natural sciences and studio work in art,
faculty have been challenging students to become engaged more personally in the Williams curriculum through field work, whether in the
form of research, sustained work on special projects or through placement with community organizations. Courses which include experien-
tial learning provide students with opportunities to encounter firsthand the issues that they read and study about, requiring them to apply
academic learning to nonacademic settings and challenging them to use their experiences in those settings to think more critically and deeply
about what they are studying. Courses involving experiential education as defined above range from fully integrated off-campus programs
such as the Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program (www.williams.edu/williamsmystic) to courses involving one small field re-
search project. The amount and nature of the experiential component(s) varies according to the instructor's judgment. Click here for a list
of 2009-2010 courses involving experiential education.
A range of non-credit experiential education opportunities is also available to interested students. Community service, internships, re-
search, and the Museum Associates Program of the College Museum of Art all provide students the chance to "learn by doing" outside the
classroom. Information on each of these opportunities is provided below.
Community Service:
Opportunities to apply creative energy and initiative abound in community organizations in the Williams College area. Service ranges
from tutoring or building homes with Habitat for Humanity, to working with developing non-profit organizations such as Northern Berkshire
Creative Arts. For more information, go to the Office for Community Engagement homepage on the College website at <www.wil-
liams.edu/resources/commservice/> or contact Stewart Burns, Director of the Center for Community Engagement (Ste-
wart.Burns@williams.edu).
Internships and Research Opportunities:
A wide variety of summer internship opportunities are available to interested students through the Office of Career Counseling (OCC) and
the Center for Environmental Studies (CES). Research opportunities are also available through individual departments. Information about
OCC's Williams College Alumni Sponsored Summer Internships can be found at http://www.williams.edu/go/careers/ or by con-
tacting Ron Gallagher, Assistant Director of Career Counseling (Ronald.L.Gallagher@williams.edu). Information about CES's
summer internship and research opportunities can be found at http://www.williams.edu/CES/ces/studentopps/employ-
ment.htm or by contacting Sarah Gardner, Associate Director of the Center for Environmental Studies, Harper House (Sarah.S.Gar-
10
dner@williams.edu). Information about research opportunities sponsored by individual departments is available from Department
Chairs.
Museum Associates:
The Museum Associates Program of the Williams College Museum of Art provides students an opportunity to broaden their knowledge of
art and art history, to learn about the field of museum education, and to develop valuable communication and public speaking skills while
working with the public. The only academic requirement is the completion of ArtH 101-102. Applications are accepted every spring. For
more information, contact Cynthia Way, Director of Education at Cynthia.Way@williams.edu.
For more information about experiential education at Williams College, visit the Experiential Education website at www.williams.e-
du/admin/deanfac/exped/ or contact Paula Consolini, Coordinator of Experiential Education at 597-4588 (pconsoli@williams.e-
du)
Honors Program
Williams awards the degree with honors to those students who have demonstrated imagination, initiative, and intellectual independence
within the major. The Honors Program requires two or three courses constituting a clearly interrelated pattern of study, whether in the form of
a thesis, specialization within the major, or interdisciplinary study with courses from other programs or departments. At least one of the
courses must be in addition to the minimum number required for the major; one may be a Winter Study Project. A student who is completing
two majors may be a candidate for honors in either or both of the majors, but a course for honors in one major may not be used as an honors
course in the other. Some programs also award honors for their concentrations.
Individual departments and programs describe special criteria, procedures, and patterns of study for honors in the "Courses of Instruction"
section. Students should consult with their departments on their honors options prior to the senior year. Before the student has begun the last
of the required course units, the department or program determines whether the student is admitted to honors candidacy. The degree is
awarded with Honors or Highest Honors at the end of the senior year if, in the judgment of the department, its criteria of excellence have been
met.
Independent Study
When a particularly able student wishes to study a subject not covered by the normal offerings of the College, arrangements may be made
to undertake courses of independent study under faculty supervision. Such arrangements are made with the appropriate department at the
time of registration.
Study Away from Williams
Many students decide to study at another college or university, in this country or abroad, during their undergraduate education. The Col-
lege encourages students to think about the option of study away as they begin the process of considering major fields and course require-
ments during the sophomore year.
All students in good standing with no deficiencies, including financial aid recipients, may study away on approved programs during all or
part of the junior year. Academic credit is earned after evidence of the satisfactory completion of the program. A student wishing to enroll in
another institution or program in this country or abroad, and to transfer credits earned on this program to Williams, must consult with Dean
Laura McKeon and the appropriate department chair early in the fall semester of the sophomore year. Students are responsible for reading the
Guide to Study Abroad available in the Dean's Office. They should also consult faculty members with expertise in the area or region of
interest to them. All students who are curious about the off-campus study option should browse through the reference library in the Dean's
Office and attend one of the general information meetings that Dean McKeon offers throughout the autumn and in February. After attending
an information session, students are free to schedule an appointment with the Dean. Approval is required from the chair of the student's major
department, Dean McKeon, and the Committee on Academic Standing. Students wishing to study away for any portion of the junior year
must request approval in March of the sophomore year by submitting a pink petition to Dean McKeon.
When a student has decided to accept an offer of admission from a program, he or she must notify the Dean's Office. The Committee on
Academic Standing will make a final decision at that time. Students must attend a pre-departure meeting and meet all the guidelines as di-
rected in the Guide to Study Abroad. Upon return to Williams, students must complete a program evaluation in order to receive credit.
The Williams Tutorial Program
The Tutorial Program offers Williams students a distinctive opportunity to take a heightened form of responsibility for their own intellec-
tual development. No student is required to take a tutorial course, but any student with the appropriate qualifications and interests is invited to
do so.
Tutorials at the 100/200 level are designed primarily for first-year students and sophomores; they are usually given enrollment preference
for such courses, though interested juniors and seniors are often welcome. Tutorials at the 300/400 level are designed primarily for juniors
and seniors (and, often, for majors in the discipline); first-year students and sophomores are welcome to apply, but are urged to consult the
instructor before registering.
Tutorials place much greater weight than do regular courses--or even small seminars--on student participation. They aim to teach stu-
dents how to develop and present arguments; listen carefully, and then refine their positions in the context of a challenging discussion; and
respond quickly and cogently to critiques of their work. Tutorials place particular emphasis on developing analytical skills, writing abilities,
and the talents of engaging in rigorous conversation and oral debate.
The ways in which particular tutorials are conducted vary across the disciplines, but here is a description of how most tutorials at Williams
are organized. Tutorials are usually limited to ten students. At the start of term, the instructor divides the students into pairs. Each pair meets
weekly with the instructor for roughly one hour. Many tutorial courses begin and end the term with a group seminar, and in a few depart-
ments, instructors hold weekly group meetings of all tutorial members to provide background information designed to facilitate the students'
independent work. But the heart of every tutorial course is the weekly meeting of the two students with the instructor.
At these weekly meetings, one student delivers a prepared essay or presentation (e.g., an analysis of a text or work of art, a discussion of a
problem set, a report on laboratory exercises, etc.) pertaining to the assignment for that week, while the other student--and then the instruc-
tor--offer a critique. In the following week, students switch roles. Typically, students write five or six essays (usually in the range of 4-7
pages) during the term, and offer five or six critiques of their partners' work.
Since the program's inception in 1988, students have ranked tutorials among the most demanding--and rewarding--courses they have
taken at Williams. While not designed to be more difficult than other courses, tutorials are nonetheless challenging, with frequent writing
assignments and the expectation that students will be well prepared to participate actively and effectively in weekly discussions. At the same
time, students have consistently placed tutorials among the most enriching and consequential courses they have taken. They have appre-
ciated the close attention to their writing and argumentation skills; the opportunity to be held accountable, in a detailed way, for the extended
implications of their ideas; the chance to develop their oral abilities as they engage in debate; and the close intellectual bonds tutorials build
between teachers and students, and students with each other. Many students have formed important advising and mentoring relationships
with their tutorial teachers.
Registration information: Students register for tutorials as they would for any other course (but should first check the description for
prerequisites and to see if permission of the instructor is required). Because of limited enrollments and the special arrangements involved in
11
organizing tutorials, students are encouraged to determine, as early as possible, their interest in and commitment to the course. Students may
not drop or add a tutorial after the first week of class. Tutorials may not be taken on a pass/fail basis.
More information: Click here for a list of tutorials offered in 2009-2010. Students may obtain detailed information about particular
tutorials from the course descriptions and the instructors. (All tutorials have a "T" after the course number.) For general information, advice,
or suggestions about the program, please contact Professor Stephen Fix, Tutorial Program Director for 2009-2010, in Stetson.
Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University
Williams offers a year-long programme of studies at Oxford University in cooperation with Exeter College, Oxford. Based at Ephraim
Williams House, Williams' study center at Oxford, the Programme is designed to offer the fullest possible integration of the students into the
intellectual and social life of one of the world's great universities. It makes full use of the Oxford tutorial system and the Oxford three-term
calendar is followed.
In addition to extensive opportunities to pursue British and Commonwealth studies, the Programme also offers instruction in other fields
for which Oxford is particularly noted or which are represented only marginally or infrequently in the Williams curriculum. Interested stu-
dents should consult the Dean's Office. Click here for a more complete description of the programme.
Williams-Mystic Maritime Studies Program
The William-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportunity to explore the ocean, to travel the Atlantic,
Pacific and Gulf Coasts, and to undertake original research of their own design in the humanities and sciences. A term at Williams-Mystic
satisfies both a semester's credit and one winter study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four Williams courses are
offered as an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum in the semester-long program at Mystic Seaport, in Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime
History, Literature of the Sea, Marine Policy, and either Marine Ecology or Oceanography (see the American Maritime Studies section in this
catalog). Williams College faculty members serve as the Director and Marine Scientist. Travel includes an offshore voyage on the open
ocean sailing aboard a tall ship, a seminar along the Pacific Coast, and a Louisiana seminar, all of which are cross-disciplinary and inter-dis-
ciplinary exercises. Students live in historic, cooperative, coed houses at Mystic Seaport, the world's largest maritime museum, and have full
access to world-class maritime collections, a maritime library, well-equipped laboratory, and diverse coastal habitats (where field research
can be undertaken in a wide variety of environments, ranging from tidepools and salt marshes to sandy beaches and estuaries). Students also
participate in maritime skills under professional instruction, with choices such as celestial navigation, maritime art, music of the sea, boat
building, or small boat handling and sailing. Williams-Mystic seeks candidates who are willing to try new things and work in a compelling
academic environment. No sailing experience necessary, and all majors are welcome--a typical semester at Williams-Mystic is represented
by 12 to 14 different majors spanning the sciences and humanities. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors can attend. Interested students should
contact Williams-Mystic at admissions@williamsmystic.org, call (860-572-5359), visit the website (www.williams.edu/williams-
mystic), or obtain a Williams-Mystic catalog from the Dean's Office. Applications are on the web and at the Dean's office. Financial aid and
scholarships are available.

ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS
Attendance
In order to give students a larger share of responsibility for their own education, Williams College does not administer a general system of required
classroom attendance. The College expects students to make full use of their educational opportunities by regular class attendance and to assume the
academic risks incurred by absences.
Although no formal system of class attendance is maintained by the College, instructors may set such standards of attendance as they feel are neces-
sary for the satisfactory conduct of their courses. Students who fail to meet these standards may be warned by the instructor and notice sent to the Dean
that continued absence will result in their being dropped from the course. A failing grade will be assigned to any course dropped after the regular course
change period. Students who do not attend the first class meeting in a semester course or Winter Study Project may be required to withdraw by the
instructor. Attendance is required at announced tests and final examinations unless the student is specifically excused by the instructor or the Dean's
Office. Satisfactory attendance in four quarters of activities approved by the Department of Physical Education is required except for students excused
by the Dean and the Director of Health.
Registration
Registration for fall and spring semesters and for the Winter Study Program takes place at designated periods during the academic year. There may
be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes accepted after the announced deadlines, including the subject designation for cross-listed
courses.
New students register online in early summer; soon after arrival at Williams, they meet with their assigned Academic Advisors to discuss the curric-
ulum and their course selections. All course changes for new students are made after these meetings. During the first two years of study, students are
limited in the number of courses they may take in one department or subject each semester as follows:
a) First-year students may take no more than one course with the same course prefix, nor more than two in one department, in a semester.
b) Sophomores may take no more than two courses with the same course prefix, nor more than three in one department, in a semester.
c) Sophomores may take no more than three courses with the same course prefix, nor more than four in one department, during the full year.
d) A student may take no more than a total of five courses with the same course prefix, nor more than eight in one department, during the first two years.
e) Any exception to the above early concentration rule may be requested by a petition (goldenrod) to the Committee on Academic Standing (C.A.S.) filed
at the time of registration.
Course Change Period
Course changes may be made during a designated period at the beginning of each semester. No course changes may be made after that period except
with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing, after consultation with the Dean's Office. During Winter Study, a second Winter Study
Project may be added if the instructor approves but the original Project may not be dropped. A processing fee of $5 per day may be assessed for each
course change accepted after the announced deadline.
First-year and first-semester transfer students may be permitted to withdraw from one course (incurring a deficiency but no grade penalty) as late as
the tenth week of the semester. Upperclass students also may once in subsequent years withdraw from a course under the same conditions. A with-
drawal, recorded on the transcript as a "W," is granted only with the approval of the instructor and a dean and only if there is complete agreement
between the instructor and the dean that, despite conscientious effort to do the work, continuation in the course would be detrimental to the overall
educational interest or health of the student. The deficiency thereby incurred must be removed in the normal manner. See references to making
up deficiencies.
Course Load
Students are required complete four courses each semester. In exceptional cases, students may, upon petition to the Committee on Academic Stand-
ing and with departmental approval at the time of registration, elect a pattern of five semester courses in the fall semester and three in the spring or three
in the fall and five in the spring; a pass-fail course cannot be used as the fifth course in this pattern.
If a student with a disability believes that he/she is unable to pursue a full course of study, the student may petition the Disabilities and Accommoda-
tions Advisory Group for permission to pursue a reduced course load. Such a petition must be accompanied by a professional evaluation which ad-
dresses the student's inability to maintain a full course of study and discusses the rationale for a reduced course load. Upon consideration of a student's
petition and supporting documentation, the Disabilities and Accommodations Advisory Group makes a recommendation to the Committee on Aca-
demic Standing which renders decisions. Such cases are considered on an individual basis and may be initiated at any time during the student's tenure
at Williams.
Fifth Course Pass-Fail Option
Except in the case of the unbalanced course program described above, a student may, at the beginning of any semester, enroll in a fifth course that
must be specified as the pass-fail course. By the sixth week, a student must decide whether to continue the course, and if so, whether on a pass-fail or
regularly graded basis. A form for designating the option chosen will be sent from the Registrar's Office. A processing fee of $5 per day may be
assessed for 5th course grading option designations accepted after the announced deadline. A course graded "Pass" may not be used as one of the
thirty-two semester courses required to complete the degree, to fulfill distribution or major requirements, or to make up a deficiency. A pass-fail course
converted to a fifth regularly graded course may be used to fulfill distribution or major requirements or to make up a deficiency incurred in a prior term.
The grade received will be included in the calculation of the student's cumulative grade-point average.
Winter Study Project
Students must pass a Winter Study Project in each of their four years. Winter Study Projects are graded Honors, Pass, Perfunctory Pass, or Fail. All
work for Winter Study Projects must be submitted by the last day of the Winter Study Program; work may be accepted after this date only with the
permission of a dean. Students who fail their Winter Study Projects will be placed on Academic Probation by the Committee on Academic Standing
and will be required to make up the deficiency. (See references to making up deficiencies. ) Students who fail through gross neglect of
work will normally be required to resign. A student who receives a second Perfunctory Pass grade in Winter Study will be required to pass a fifth
course, which may be graded on the regular A-E or pass/fail basis, in the following spring or fall semester.
Grading System and Records
Williams uses the following system of grades: A, excellent; B, good; C, fair; D, passing; E, failing. These letters, with plus and minus value, have the
following numerical equivalents in calculating grade averages:
A+ = 4.33 B+ = 3.33 C+ = 2.33 D+ = 1.33
A = 4.00 B = 3.00 C = 2.00 D = 1.00 E = 0
A = 3.67 B = 2.67 C = 1.67 D = 0.67
A permanent record of each student's grades is kept and this official record forms the basis for any academic action by the College.
A transcript of a student's cumulative academic record is available from the Registrar's Office upon written request. Transcripts will not be issued for
students who are in financial arrears.
13
Provisions relating to student records, access to them, and safeguards on their use are in the Student Handbook.
First-Year Student Warnings
In the middle of each semester, instructors report to the Registrar those first-year students whose grades at that time are unsatisfactory. The students
and their academic advisors receive notices of warnings as a matter of routine. The Dean's Office may inform parents of students who receive two or
more warnings.
Extensions of Deadlines
Deadlines for course work are set by the instructor with the following limitations:
for courses with final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 p.m. on the last day of
reading period.
for courses without final exams, the latest that written work may be due is 5:00 pm. on the third-to-last
day of the exam period.
If work is due before these deadlines, the instructor may grant an extension up to these deadlines solely at his or her discretion. Short extensions
beyond these deadlines may be granted by a dean but only with the concurrence of the instructor. No extensions will be granted beyond the examina-
tion period except in the case of serious illness.
Instructors may require students who have missed announced quizzes or hour tests to present satisfactory explanations to a dean before they are
permitted to make up the exercises.
If a student is absent from a final examination, a make-up examination may be given only with the permission of a dean and at a time determined by
the dean.
Deficiencies
A student receives credit for a course by obtaining a grade of at least D minus. A student may not repeat a course for which degree credit has
been awarded. If the student fails a course, he or she must make up the deficiency.
If a failure occurs in the first semester of a full-year course, the student may, with the consent of the instructor, continue the course and receive credit
for the second semester only. If a failure occurs in the second semester of a full-year course, credit for passing the first semester may be retained only
with the approval of the Committee on Academic Standing.
A senior who incurs a failure in the first semester in a required major course may be dropped from the College at midyear.
Normally deficiencies can be made up only by courses taken after the deficiencies have been incurred.
A student must make up a deficiency in one of these ways:
1) obtain a grade of at least C minus in a summer school course, approved in advance by the Registrar, at a regionally accredited four-year college
or university; (The grade will not, however, be included in the calculation of the student's cumulative grade point average.)
2) pass an extra graded course at Williams in the semester following the failure;
3) in the case of a first-semester failure of a year-long language course, obtain a grade of at leastaCminus in the work of the second semester of that
course. The failure for the first semester will, however, remain on the student's record and will be included in the cumulative grade point average.
A deficiency must normally be made up before the start of the following academic year, or in the case of a deficiency incurred in the spring semester,
no later than the following fall semester. A student may, in consultation with the Dean's Office, petition the Committee on Academic Standing with an
alternate plan.
Separation for Low Scholarship
It is the policy of Williams College not to permit a student to remain in residence after it has become evident that he or she is either unable or
unwilling to maintain reasonable standards of academic achievement. At the end of each term, the Committee on Academic Standing reviews all
academic records that fail to meet the following minimum academic requirements:
For first-year students: Three grades of C minus or better and no failures each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
For upperclass students: Four grades of C minus or better each semester, and
at least Perfunctory Pass on the Winter Study Project
Students whose records fail to meet these minimum academic requirements or whose records otherwise fail to show adequate progress may receive
an academic reminder, be placed on academic probation, or be required to resign.
Students who are required to resign from the College for academic reasons are normally not permitted to return for at least one year from the date of
their resignation. A student who has been required to resign from the College may petition the Committee on Academic Standing through the Dean for
reinstatement on two conditions only: all deficiencies must have been made up and a letter submitted to the Committee that offers convincing evidence
that the student is ready and able to complete work toward a degree at Williams without further interruption.
When required to resign, students must vacate their rooms promptly. Financial aid students must also see the Director of Financial Aid before leav-
ing to discuss loan repayment and renewal of aid in the event of readmission.
A student who fails to meet minimum academic standards in his or her final semester at Williams may be required by the Committee on Academic
Standing to meet them by earning grades of at least C minus elsewhere before the B.A. will be awarded. If such work is required, it must be completed
within three years unless stipulated otherwise, and the courses must be approved in advance by the Registrar.
Withdrawal from the College in Good Standing
Students may request personal leaves of absence from a dean and, if granted, withdraw from the College. Such time away, often as a period of
reassessment and self evaluation, can prove to be educationally beneficial. A withdrawal in good standing may be granted for not less than one semes-
ter and not more than three years. Students who withdraw in good standing are readmitted with the approval of the Dean's Office and are expected to
complete the degree without further interruption.
Students may request permission from a dean to withdraw at any time. If a student is granted a personal leave of absence after the semester begins,
but before the end of the drop/add period, the transcript will list the date of withdrawal as the day before the term began. If a personal leave is granted
after the end of the drop/add period, but before the end of the eighth week of the semester, the transcript will list the date of withdrawal, but the semester
will not count toward the maximum of eight allowed to complete the degree. If a personal withdrawal is allowed after the eighth week of the semester,
the transcript will list the date of withdrawal and the courses in progress, each with a W; the semester will normally count toward the maximum of eight
allowed to complete the degree and the student will incur deficiencies that must be made up before returning to the College.
14
Refunds
Payment refund or credit in the event of withdrawal is described here.
Eligibility for and Completion of Majors
To be eligible for any major, students must have received grades of C minus or better in each course in the major taken in the first two years of
college and Honors or Pass on any Winter Study Project taken in the major department or program. A senior may enter a major only upon the approval
of the department chair and the Committee on Academic Standing.
All semester courses in the major must be taken on a regularly graded basis. In addition to passing each major course and, where required, a major
Winter Study Project, the student must maintain an average in the major of 1.67 or higher. Seniors who have an average below 1.67 in the major field
normally will not be allowed to continue. A senior who receives a grade of E in the first semester of a required major course may be dropped from the
College at mid-year. A student who falls below these standards may continue in the major only with the approval of the Committee on Academic
Standing.
A senior major exercise is not required by every department but is by some. All departments requiring such an exercise specify it as such in the
description of their major programs in the "Courses of Instruction" section, and all students in those departments must complete the exercise satisfacto-
rily.
Eligibility for Extracurricular Activities
A student is eligible to represent the College in any athletic, dramatic, literary, or musical event and be in the student government, or other organiza-
tion as a member, substitute, or officer, unless he or she is declared ineligible:
1) by the Dean;
2) by vote of the Discipline Committee; or
3) by vote of the Committee on Academic Standing because of a dangerously low record.
The Student Honor Committee may recommend to the Dean loss of eligibility as a penalty for a violation of the Honor Code.
Dean's List
All students who attain a semester average of 3.50 or higher in a program of four or more courses are placed on the Dean's List for that semester.
Phi Beta Kappa Society
Students of the highest academic standing are eligible for election to membership in the Phi Beta Kappa Society in accordance with the following
rules:
1) The requirements for election to membership shall be a grade point average of 3.3 and Honors or Pass in all required Winter Study Projects.
There shall be two elections of new members for each class, at the end of the junior and senior years.
2) At the end of the junior year, all students in the highest five percent of the class, ranked by cumulative grade point average, shall be eligible for
election provided they have met the requirements and have completed enough courses to be considered candidates for the B.A. degree in the following
year. A student who leaves Williams at the end of the junior year to attend graduate school may be elected under the above procedures.
At the end of the senior year, all students not yet elected and in the highest 12.5 per cent of the class, ranked by cumulative grade point average, shall
be eligible for election provided they have met the requirements.
3) Students shall be eligible for election only if they have been students at Williams College for at least two years.
4) Honorary members may be elected from distinguished alumni of at least twenty years' standing. No more than one such member shall be elected
each year.
5) Any student who shall have gained his or her rank by unfair means or who in the judgment of the Dean of the College is not of good moral
character is ineligible to election.
6) The name of a member elect shall be entered on the roll only after he or she has accepted the election and has paid to the Treasurer the regular
entrance fee.
7) Any undergraduate member who withdraws from the College before graduation or who falls short of the minimum Phi Beta Kappa scholastic
standing may, upon a two-thirds vote of the members present at the annual meeting, be deprived of membership in the society.
8) Any undergraduate member who is expelled from the College shall be deprived of membership in the Society.
9) While connected with Williams College as an officer of instruction or administration, any graduate of Williams College who is a member of
another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall be considered a regular member of the Williams chapter.
10) While connected with Williams College as professor, associate professor or assistant professor, or an officer of administration, any member of
another chapter of Phi Beta Kappa shall have all the privileges of the Williams chapter, including holding office and voting. While connected with
Williams College, any other officer of instruction or administration who is a member of another chapter shall have all the privileges of the Williams
chapter, except holding office and voting.
Awarding of Degrees
By vote of the Trustees, the degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred at Commencement upon students who have completed the requirements as to
courses and grades to the satisfaction of the Faculty. The right to a degree may, however, be forfeited by misconduct at any time prior to the conferring
of the degree. No degree in absentia will be conferred except by special vote of the Trustees on petition presented to the Dean. Diplomas will not be
authorized for students who have not paid College charges or have not returned all books belonging to the library.
Graduation with Distinction
The Faculty will recommend to the Trustees that the degree of Bachelor of Arts with distinction be conferred upon those members of the graduating
class who have passed all Winter Study Projects and obtained a four year average in the top:
35% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts cum laude or higher
15% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts magna cum laude or higher
2% of the graduating class -- Bachelor of Arts summa cum laude
15
ACADEMIC ADVISING
A variety of academic advice and counsel is offered to students. Instructors, departmental and administrative officers and some special programs are
available to partner with students to help them explore and develop their academic interests and talents and take advantage of the academic and intellec-
tual opportunities available through the College.
In the first-year, each student is assigned an Academic Advisor who is either a member of the faculty or an administrative officer whose responsibili-
ties keep him or her in close contact with the curriculum of the College. The Deans of the College also advise undergraduates and coordinate the
first-year advising program, review the academic progress of individual students, and--when appropriate--call students in to discuss their situations.
In the sophomore year, students continue to meet with their first-year advisors and it is recommended that they seek advice from deans and instruc-
tors, along with pre-professional and other special advisors (click here for a list). Sophomores are also encouraged to discuss major options and re-
quirements with faculty members from departments and programs in which they have an interest before declaring a major in the spring semester.
In the junior and senior years, students are advised by faculty from their major departments or programs. Each department or program determines its
own advising system for its majors, although chairs are regularly available for consultation.
ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE
Additional programs of academic assistance are also available through the Academic Resources office. Any student who desires extra help in a
course in which he or she is registered may request a tutor who has been recommended by the respective departments to the Academic Resources
office; costs of this tutoring are covered by Academic Resources. Students seeking to enhance their writing skills in any course may take advantage of
the Writing Workshop. Trained and supervised by a coordinator, student writing tutors provide assistance on papers already corrected and with drafts of
papers in any stage of the writing process. The Math and Science Resource Center (MSRC), a drop-in help center staffed by student tutors who come
highly recommended from the respective departments, is also available to students of Biology 101, 102, and 202, Chemistry 151, 153, 155, 156, 251,
255, and 256, Mathematics 100, 101, 103, 104, 105, and 106, and Physics 131, 132, 141, and 142. The MSRC (which is open from 8 p.m. to 12
midnight Sundays through Thursdays throughout both academic semesters) works in close cooperation with the faculty teaching those courses.
All students are encouraged to take full advantage of these academic resources.
STUDY ABROAD AND INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS
Advising of Williams students wishing to study abroad in the junior year is coordinated by the Dean's Office. Information sessions are held during
the fall semester and early spring of the sophomore year for students wishing to study abroad. Orientation and counseling of international students is
arranged by the International Student Advisor in the Dean's Office.

16
ACADEMIC HONESTY
All students are expected to be familiar with the Williams College Honor Code and to reaffirm their commitment to the Statement of Academic
Honesty at the beginning of each academic year. The Honor Code covers all aspects of academic honesty, including the writing of papers and laborato-
ry reports as well as all quizzes, homework assignments, hour tests, and examinations.
Statement of Academic Honesty
As an institution fundamentally concerned with the free exchange of ideas, Williams College has always depended on the academic integrity of each
of its members. In the spirit of this free exchange, the students and faculty of Williams recognize the necessity and accept the responsibility for academ-
ic honesty.
A student who enrolls at the College thereby agrees to respect and acknowledge the research and ideas of others in his or her work and to abide by
those regulations governing work stipulated by the instructor. Any student who breaks these regulations, misrepresents his or her own work, or collabo-
rates in the misrepresentation of another's work has committed a serious violation of this agreement.
Students and faculty are to report violations and alleged violations of this agreement. Such reports are to be submitted to the Student Honor Commit-
tee, consisting of eight student members of the joint Faculty-Student Honor System-Discipline Committee. This committee is responsible for determin-
ing the guilt or innocence of the accused person or persons, and for recommending appropriate punishments to the Dean. A committee of faculty
members to be designated by the Faculty will sit with the Student Honor Committee in an advisory capacity.
A quorum of three-quarters shall be required for the Committee to meet. A vote of guilty by at least three-quarters of those present is necessary for
conviction. A recommendation for dismissal must be made by unanimous vote of those present, and shall be carried out only with the assent of the
President of the College.
The Committee is responsible for informing the student body of the meaning and implications of this statement. The aforementioned faculty com-
mittee shall be responsible for informing faculty members of the meaning and implications of this statement.
Any amendments to this statement must be made through a student referendum in which two-thirds of the student body votes, and in which two-
thirds of those voting vote for the amendment. These alterations must be ratified by the Faculty.
Adopted 1971
Guidelines
Instructors are encouraged to submit to the Honor Committee a written statement defining how the Statement of Academic Honesty applies to their
courses or laboratories, and to explain such guidelines to their students. Instructors may set any type of final examination or hour test, ranging from
closed-book, alternate-seating classroom exercises to open-book, "take-home" examinations or papers, and any requirements for laboratory exercises.
Some instructors encourage cooperation among students but others do not. If a student is unsure how the Honor Code applies in a particular situation, it
is ultimately the student's responsibility to find out from his or her professor, or from a member of the Honor Committee, how the Honor Code applies
in that situation. An open and highly individualized system can last only as long as both the students and the faculty work together to create a true
academic community.
In written material, students are expected to avoid the possibility of even unintentional plagiarism by acknowledging the sources of their work.
Careful observance of accepted standards of reference and attribution is required. The basic rules are summarized below. Students are further advised to
consult a recognized style manual to learn how to acknowledge sources correctly. While academic honesty does not demand a footnote on statements
of common fact, it does require that a student provide clear footnotes or other appropriate documentation and give credit in the bibliography to ideas,
interpretations, and facts that particular sources have contributed to the student's final work.
The basic rules of attribution require that:
1) A direct quotation (whether a single word or a phrase, sentence, paragraph, or series of paragraphs) must always be identified by quotation
marks, by indenting and single spacing, or by reduced type size of the quoted material, and a note must be used to state the exact source.
2) A paraphrase of the work of another must be acknowledged as such by a note stating the source.
3) Indebtedness to the specific ideas of others, or the summarizing of several pages, even though expressed in different words, must be acknowl-
edged by a note stating the source.
4) Every instance of the use of another student's laboratory reports, computer programs, or other material must be acknowledged by a note.
5) Even the use of a student's own previous work must be acknowledged; thus, a student must obtain the prior permission of all instructors con-
cerned before submitting substantially the same paper in more than one course.
Procedures for Alleged Violations
Students or faculty members who have discovered a violation or a possible violation of the Honor Code should report it promptly either to the
faculty chair or to the student chair of the Honor Committee. As soon as possible after receiving a report of an alleged Honor Code violation, the
Student Honor Committee will convene to hear the case. The person bringing the charge will present the evidence to the Committee in the presence of
the accused student, who may then speak in his or her own defense both with and without the accuser present. After the accused student has left the
proceedings, the Committee will determine innocence or guilt and, if the latter, will recommend an appropriate penalty to the Dean. Depending on the
circumstances of the violation, penalties then imposed by the Dean may include such possibilities as a directed grade of E in the course, disciplinary
probation, or temporary or permanent separation from the College.
17
EXPENSES
Within the limits of available funds, Williams endeavors to offer its educational opportunities to all who qualify for admission. Income from its
endowment and annual contributions from its alumni and friends have enabled Williams to keep its tuition at about half the actual cost per student to the
College.
Payment of Term Bills
College bills for one-half of all tuition and fees are mailed to parents twice a year (in mid-July and mid-December) for payment on August 17 and
January 15; a fee of $250 may be charged if payment is received after these dates. Term bills must be paid before the semester's classes begin or the
student may not be permitted to enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Billing statements for accounts with outstanding balances or
current activity will be issued monthly and are due upon receipt.
All outstanding balances must be paid to the Bursar, and all books and materials must be returned to the Library, before the student is entitled to a
degree or a transcript.
College Bills
College charges for tuition, room, board, and fees for the academic year 2009-2010 are as follows:
Tuition $39,250
Room Fee (including telephone service) 5,280
Full Board 5,110
Student Activities Fee* 190
House Maintenance Fee (upperclass) or First-Year Dues 50
_______
$49,880
Other Expenses
Based on a study of expenses reported by financial aid students, a minimum normal budget for a college year at Williams includes additional ex-
penses estimated as follows:
Books 800
Clothing, Laundry, Recreation approximately 1200
_______
Estimated year's total, exclusive of travel expenses** $2,000
________________
*A student activities fee for support of non-athletic student organizations is charged to all undergraduates as part of the College term
bill. It includes, for example, subscriptions to the college newspaper, and admission to most drama productions and musical events on
campus.
**Travel expenses are not included in figures listed above. The cost of two round-trip tickets is added into each successful financial aid
candidate's award.
Additional Items
A House Maintenance Fee of $50 per year is charged to upperclassmen as a part of the College term bill. It is used to provide a base for the social and
cultural programs of each residential House and to meet any unusual maintenance expenses for the Houses. First-year class dues of $50 are charged at
the rate of $25 each semester. Co-op residents and off-campus residents are charged a $25 neighborhood residential fee each semester.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts requires that all full- and part-time students enrolled in institutions of higher education located in Massachu-
setts must participate in a qualifying student health insurance plan offered by the institution or in another health insurance program affording compara-
ble coverage.
The College offers a qualifying student health insurance plan to all students. The College will allow students to waive participation in this insurance
plan if the student will certify in writing, before the beginning of the academic year, that the coverage offered by an alternative program chosen by the
student is comparable to that of the qualifying program available at the College.
Information about the student health insurance program offered by the College, including current details of its cost, is mailed to all students each
year. Additional information about this program or about the Commonwealth's requirements is available through the Thompson Health Center at (413)
597-3166.
There may be a $5 per day processing fee for any registration changes accepted after the announced deadlines. There is a charge of $25 for a lost key.
Payment of College Bills
A non-refundable deposit of $200 to reserve a place in the first-year class is required from all admitted candidates (except certain financial aid
recipients) by the Candidate's Reply Date of May 1. The deposit appears as a credit on the term bill rendered in July.
College tuition statements for one half of all fees are mailed to the billing name(s) and addresses on record twice a year--in July, payable by August
15, and in December, payable by January 15. Payment may be made by check, money order, or wire transfer. Credit cards can not be used to pay tuition
and fees. A fee of $250 may be charged if payment is received after these dates.
Students who receive a scholarship(s) that was not awarded through the Williams Office of Financial Aid must complete a Scholarship Information
Sheet and mail it to the Financial Aid Office by early June. Provisional credit will be posted to the semester bill for the following; anticipated disburse-
ments of direct loans for which a promissory note has been signed and returned to the Office of Financial Aid, anticipated disbursements of outside
loans approved by the lender, outside scholarships which have not yet been received and applied against the student account and any remaining semes-
ter contract amount for the Ten Month Payment Plan. If actual payment for the above provisional credits are not received by the date anticipated, the
provisional credit will expire and be removed from the student's account creating a balance due.
A check returned to the College for any reason such as "account closed" or "insufficient funds" will be charged to the student's term bill and a
"return check charge" of $20.00 will be assessed. The College reserves the right to require that payment be made in the form of cash, cashier check or
money order.
18
Students with bills still unpaid at the start of the semester who have not made satisfactory arrangements with the Bursar will not be permitted to
enroll in classes or remain in residence at the College. Furthermore, if arrangements for payment after the start of the semester are approved by the
Bursar and these expected payments are not made on time, students may not be allowed to enroll for the next semester.
If efforts by the Bursar's Office to collect the monies owed are unsuccessful, the account could be placed with a collection agency, and if the delin-
quency persists, the College's experience with the account may be reported to a national credit bureau. It is the policy of the College to pass on to the
debtor all reasonable costs associated with collection of the debt through a collection agency. If at any time the student believes information concerning
payment delinquency is inaccurate, he/she should notify the College c/o The Bursar's Office, P.O. Box 406, Williamstown, MA 01267.
There are several loan options available to parents through outside sources. These include the MassPlan Loan through the Massachusetts Education-
al Financing Authority and the Federal Plus Loan Program. Information on these loans can be found in the brochureA Guide to Borrowing for College.
Williams also offers an installment plan, administered by Tuition Management Services whereby the yearly charges are paid in 10 equal installments
starting in June, with no interest charges. There are no income restrictions. Monthly payments will be the total cost (less any scholarships, Stafford or
parent loans) divided by 10. There is an administration fee for this program. Information on this program is sent each spring to all parents or can be
obtained by calling Tuition Management Services at (888) 216-4258.

*Housing and miscellaneous fees are not pro-rated after the start of classes. Coverage under the College's student health insurance plan will continue
for the length of the plan (August 15, 2009-August 14, 2010).
For students receiving Title IV federal funds, repayment of federal funds on a pro-rata basis will be determined up to the 60% point of the semester
per federal regulation. Please note that withdrawal late in the semester could result in a balance owed to the College for federal aid that must be returned

ENDOWED SCHOLARSHIPS AND TUTORIALS
Distinctive Undergraduate Scholarships
Williams College, through the Office of Financial Aid, administers over three hundred endowed scholarships, all of which are based on demon-
strated need. Students who apply for financial assistance are automatically considered for all these and other endowed scholarships. No separate ap-
plication is required. Limited space prohibits the complete listing of these, but some deserve special mention because of their distinctiveness.

These scholarships are the most distinctive awards presented each year to six to eight of the most promising scholars in the first-year class. Tyng
Scholars are also eligible for assistance for up to three years of graduate/professional study.
Alumni Funded Tutorials
Tutorials bring a professor and two students together in weekly sessions that epitomize President James A. Garfield's (Class of 1856) legendary
statement: "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of the log and a student on the other." They forge student-professor bonds, teach students
about arguments, about arriving at and defending a position, and about responding on the spot to questions, criticisms, and suggestions. They also
promote critical reading, the writing of succinct analyses, and oral defense.
The College recognizes the Classes of 1953, 1954, and 1979 with deepest gratitude for supporting tutorials with their generous 25th and 50th Re-
union gifts. Williams is also pleased to recognize the following individuals and families who have created generous endowments to support tutorials,
many in honor of their 25th and 50th Reunions: Hugh Germanetti 1954, David A. Gray 1954, Robert L. Guyett 1958, The Hunter Family, John D.
Mabie 1954, and John H. Simpson 1979, The Testa Family.
20
PREPARATIONFORGRADUATEAND PROFESSIONALSTUDY
Although the principle function of Williams is to provide a broad and solid liberal education that will be of lasting value no matter what the vocation
a student may pursue, the College recognizes that no fundamental conflict exists between a liberal education and preparation for a professional career;
on the contrary, a foundation of liberal studies increases professional competence in any field. A student should plan his or her program of study so as to
provide as much educational breadth and enrichment as circumstances permit. A student should also give serious consideration to post-college plans
early in the college career.
Each departmental major provides the foundation for graduate study in the corresponding field. Students should consult the departmental programs
listed under "Courses of Instruction" for requirements, and for special advice regarding preparation for graduate study. Students should also consult
with the appropriate departmental chairman or the special faculty advisors as early as possible in their college careers to make certain they have taken
all the necessary factors into consideration.
Particular attention is called to the foreign language requirements of graduate study. Candidates for the degree of doctor of philosophy at almost all
graduate schools are required to have a reading knowledge of both French and German. Under certain circumstances another language may replace
French. Many graduate schools require also a knowledge of Latin for students of English and Romantic Languages. Candidates for the master of arts
degree are required to have a reading knowledge of either French or German. Students should consult departmental chairmen or the faculty advisors for
the requirements in specific fields of study.
Visual Arts
Students interested in graduate studies in art or architecture should meet with faculty with whom they have completed advanced work in the areas
they wish to pursue. Their counsel and that of the Department of Art Academic Advisor, Ed Epping, can help the student narrow the search of pro-
grams that would best match the student's needs. The specific requirements of all art and architecture schools offering Master of Arts and/or Master of
Fine Arts is available from their online resource.
The College Art Association (CAA) has written:
"Admission to (graduate) programs should be based on the nature, extent, and quality of under-
graduate preparation, including courses in studio, art history, and other academic subjects. Quality
of studio preparation can best be judged on the basis of careful evaluation of work done at the un-
dergraduate level; therefore, a portfolio review (usually represented by slides) is regarded as an
absolute necessity in the admission process.
While many institutions consider the BFA to be the standard qualifying degree, the fact that the
applicant has attended a BA- or BS-granting institution does not necessarily rule out acceptance
in most MFA programs. Whatever the undergraduate degree, most entering graduate students tend
not to be completely prepared in one or more of the areas cited above and will require remedial
make-up work...
Some institutions use the MA degree as a qualifying prerequisite for final acceptance into MFA
candidacy, allowing the student to apply the earned credits toward the higher degree."
Students are advised to take into consideration not only current minimum requirements but also recommended courses.
Business Administration
Williams offers no special course in preparation for a business career for graduate study in business administration. The qualities which are impor-
tant to succeed in business, and which graduate business schools are seeking, are an ability to reason and to express oneself logically and clearly in
written and oral exposition; a good understanding of the physical and social environment in which business operates; a solid background in quantitative
skills; and an appreciation of human motivations and goals. This means that a broad liberal arts program is preferred over a highly specialized one.
Within this broad prescription it may be desirable to have at least one year of economics and one year of mathematics (including statistics and
calculus). For those interested in production management or operation research, additional work in any quantitative course and/or a course in computer
science would be helpful.
But there is no particular major at Williams that is designated as preparation for the business profession. Students interested in futures in business are
encouraged to undertake a broad educational program in the arts, humanities, and sciences. It is important that one gets involved in extra-curricular
activities, one holds a leadership position, and pursuing relevant summer internship is critical.
Students interested in graduate work in business administration should consult with the Pre-MBA Advisor, Robin Meyer, at the Office of Career
Counseling.
Engineering
Many Williams graduates enjoy productive careers in engineering, applied science, or technical management. Successful engineers need to
be able to communicate effectively, reason logically, and understand both the technical and the social dimensions of a problem. A prospective
engineer should major in one of the sciences (usually physics, chemistry, computer science, or mathematics), while pursuing a broad liberal arts
education at Williams. Most often he or she will complete a Williams B.A. in the usual four years and then go to an engineering school for
professional training leading to a master's degree or doctorate in engineering. While it may be necessary to make up a few undergraduate engi-
neering courses, the opportunities at Williams to participate in scientific research and the breadth of a liberal arts education prepare Williams
graduates to succeed in engineering graduate study and in their careers.
The booklet "Choosing First Year Courses" contains a list of Williams courses recommended to prospective engineers. Students interested in
engineering also have the opportunity to take undergraduate engineering courses at other institutions. Williams maintains formal exchange
programs with California Institute of Technology, Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
Williams students can arrange to study at one of these leading engineering schools for one or two semesters, typically during the junior year.
Please see the "Exchange Programs" section of this catalog for more information. The 3-2 program offers another opportunity to study engi-
neering at the undergraduate level. Please see the "Combined Program in Liberal Arts and Engineering" section for information.
The pre-engineering advisor, Professor Jefferson Strait, will be happy to help plan course selections and to discuss the possible paths to a career in
engineering. Many more details about pre-engineering can be found in the Physics Department section of the College website.
21
Law
Williams graduates regularly proceed directly to law schools on the strength of their liberal arts education. As a rule, law schools do not require
particular pre-law curriculum for undergraduates. Consequently, application and admission to law school is open to qualified students from all academ-
ic disciplines. This does not mean, however, that law schools are indifferent to one's undergraduate academic experience. In fact, law schools will be
very conscious of the quality and rigor of one's undergraduate education. A serious student, considering law school, will heed this advice and undertake
a challenging program.
Students intending to study law should consult with the Pre-Law Advisor, Dawn Dellea, at the Office of Career Counseling. Also, on a regular basis,
law schools from around the country will visit Williams to provide information and to answer questions from potential applicants. Check the OCC
calendar for notice of these visits.
The Health Professions
Many Williams graduates elect to pursue a career in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, public health, or other health-related fields. All are
welcome to seek guidance from the Health Professions Office within the Office of Career Counseling.
Students interested in medicine and related fields should pursue a broad liberal arts education, letting enthusiasm for subjects be a guide. In most
cases, a student should acquire volunteer service and field-specific internship experience in an effort to confirm interest in the chosen field. With careful
planning, any major can be studied.
In order to pursue a career in a health-related field, a student must pay particular attention to the courses required for graduate school admission. In
certain fields, upwards of twelve courses are listed as prerequisites. The general requirements for many programs are outlined in "Choosing First Year
Courses," but each student considering advanced study in health fields should meet with the Health Professions Advisor early in the college career to
ensure that planned coursework will meet satisfy admissions requirements.
Jane Cary, the Health Professions Advisor, will be happy to discuss goals and specific steps which might help a student realize them. Detailed
information is available at the Health Professions website (www.williams.edu/go/careers/prehealth_welcome.php).
Pre-College and College Teaching/Research
A central qualification for careers in teaching at any level is proficiency in a major. Students interested in college teaching and research should
prepare themselves at Williams for graduate work in the subject of their choice. Those interested in teaching at the elementary or secondary level
should plan to attain state certification and/or earn an MAT or M.Ed at a good graduate school. There are many opportunities to do teaching internships
and study education as an undergraduate while at Williams.
Students interested in college teaching should consult with the chairs of the departments in which they intend to major. Those interested in teaching
at the elementary and secondary level should consult with the Director of the Program in Teaching. Additional advice for both of these options is also
available at the Office of Career Counseling.
Teaching After Williams
There are many options for teaching after Williams, including independent and public school teaching. Many states now offer streamlined programs
to certify public school teachers, and many states offer a wide range of options for acquiring certification while you teach.
Students interested in teaching may want to consider participating in the Program in Teaching at Williams which is designed to enable undergradu-
ates to study the ideas, questions, and practices involved in good teaching at all levels. The program is open to any student interested in education and
offers opportunities for all levels of interest, including those who want to find out about certification and graduate study (see page ? for more details).
Students should contact Susan Engel, the Director of the Program, to find out how they might participate in the program.
Students who want career advice should contact the Office of Career Counseling which has a very active on-campus educational recruiting program
that includes many private schools as well as Teach for America and similar programs. The program begins in the fall and continues through the spring.
Students interested in teaching at independent elementary- or secondary-level schools or participating in the Teach for America or similar programs
directly after graduation from Williams (certification is not required) should consult with the Office of Career Counseling.
Religious Study
There is no particular path through the Williams curriculum designed or recommended for students intending to prepare for a career as a religious
professional, enroll in a seminary or pursue theological education. Most undergraduate liberal arts courses can be useful to the prospective minister,
priest, rabbi, imam, or teacher of religion. Ordination requirements vary widely depending on the particular religious community or tradition; in some
cases it may be possible to make progress on certain credentials in academic study or field experience during the undergraduate years. A basic founda-
tion in the study of religion is certainly helpful--sacred texts, scriptural languages, history, philosophy, phenomenology and comparative studies, etc.
Students contemplating advanced academic work in religious studies in preparation for a career in teaching or scholarship should give serious consid-
eration to concentrated undergraduate study in the field.
Students with vocational interests that may include ordination or certification as a religious professional are urged to make themselves known to one
of the chaplains (or, where appropriate, one of the local clergy) as soon as these interests begin to come into focus. Those interested in graduate academ-
ic programs in religious studies should consult with the faculty advisor in that field.
22
GRADUATE PROGRAMS AT WILLIAMS
Master of Arts in Policy Economics
The Center for Development Economics (CDE), which opened at Williams College in 1960, offers an intensive one-year program in economic
analysis leading to the degree of Master of Arts in Policy Economics. The program is specifically designed for economists from developing countries
who have already embarked on professional careers in the public sector. The curriculum requires courses in development economics, macroeconom-
ics, public finance, and econometrics. CDE fellows choose among other courses in lecture, seminar, and tutorial formats. Course electives for
2009-2010 include the following: developing country macroeconomics II; finance and development; empirical methods in macroeconomics; the prac-
tice of monetary policy; computable general equilibrium modeling; tax policy; institutions and governance; international trade; international financial
institutions; development successes; and the role of social safety nets. Williams undergraduates who satisfy course prerequisites, with the consent of the
individual instructor, are encouraged to take courses at the CDE. Admission to the master's degree program is highly selective, with several hundred
applicants each year for approximately 25 places. Candidates normally have a B.A. or B.Sc. degree with honors in economics or a related field, two or
more years of relevant work experience, and an effective command of spoken and written English. CDE fellows are often nominated for the program
by public agencies from which they will be on leave.
More information is available on the CDE website, www.williams.edu/cde. All communications relating to the degree of Master of Arts in Policy
Economics should be addressed to the CDE, Assistant Director, 1065 Main Street, Williams College, Williamstown, MA 01267, or e-mail
cde@williams.edu.
Master of Arts in the History of Art
In cooperation with the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williams College offers a two-year course of study leading to the degree of Master
of Arts in the History of Art. The objective of the program is to offer to a small number of students a thorough professional preparation for careers in
teaching and museums, and to enable them to pursue further research whether independently or at other institutions offering higher degrees. The curric-
ulum consists of seminars in a wide range of art historical subjects. Opportunities are provided for practical experience in museum work at The Clark,
the Williams College Museum of Art, and the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. The study of primary materials is further extended by
field trips to other collections. The degree is normally awarded after two years of resident graduate study. To earn the degree, students must take ten
courses, of which at least six must be graduate seminars (including ARTH 504). In connection with the preparation of a paper for the Graduate Sympo-
sium, students will register for an eleventh course (ARTH 509), to be graded pass/fail, in their fourth semester. A demonstration of proficiency in
reading two foreign languages is required. Of these two, German is required, and French is recommended. In January of the first year, students partici-
pate in a European study trip with selected faculty; in January of the second year, students must complete a Qualifying Paper. In addition to all course
work, students must, at the end of the second year, present a shortened version of the Qualifying Paper in a graduate symposium to be held on Com-
mencement weekend. To enter the program a successful applicant must have been awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts or its equivalent from an
accredited institution. An undergraduate major in art is not required for acceptance to the program.

aging young people of reliability, good sense and high purpose to enter with adequate preparation those fields of politics and constitutional gov-
ernment upon which must rest the future of this nation."

COURSES OF INSTRUCTION 2009-2010
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Courses designated by a single number are semester courses.
Year courses are designated by an odd number and an even number joined by a hyphen; the work of the two semesters constitutes an integral, indivisible
course. Therefore, if a student does not pass the second half of a year-long course, he or she forfeits credit for the first half and incurs a deficiency as a result of the
forfeiture. Students who register for a year course are required to do both semesters of that course within the same academic year.
In some departments, course numbers have special meanings that are explained in their listings.
The (F) or (S) following a course's number indicates the semester, fall or spring, in which the course will be offered.
THESE SYMBOLS ARE USED IN DEPARTMENTAL MASTHEADS TO INDICATE FACULTY STATUS:
*On leave for the year
* *On leave fall semester
* * *On leave spring semester
Visiting or adjunct, part-time fall semester
 Visiting or adjunct, part-time spring semester
  Adjunct WSP

also an option for students wishing to conduct advanced research and study. Additional courses may be taken with affiliated faculty and visiting professors associ-
ated with the program. We encourage students to take at least one course in a program/department other than Africana Studies and consider an experiential
learning winter study session; however, the majority of your courses should be selected from among those offered by core faculty.
The honors thesis, taken in addition to the five courses with permission of the chair/mentoring faculty, consists of one or two semesters of work and a winter
study.
Courses offered by the program:
AFR 200 Introduction to Africana Studies
AFR 400 Senior Seminar

HONORS PROGRAM IN AFRICANA STUDIES
A candidate for honors in Africana Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the concentration and be admitted to candidacy by the program faculty. In
addition to the five courses normally required for the concentration, an honors candidate will enroll in either AFR 491 or 492 plus a Winter Study in his or her
senior year, in order to complete a substantial written thesis or an equivalent project in the performing or studio arts. A student wishing to become a candidate for
honors in Africana Studies should secure a faculty sponsor and inform the program chair in writing before spring registration of her/his junior year.
An honors project should demonstrate creativity, depth, and intellectual rigor. A candidate for honors is encouraged to pursue non-traditional projects, such as
presentations in the performing arts, visual arts, or creative writing, as well as more conventional research projects. The advisor will evaluate the honors project,
and the program faculty will then decide whether to confer honors.
STUDY ABROAD
The curricular impact on potential majors of studying abroad in the junior year would be positive if students chose to study in countries that reflect the Africana
diaspora.

offered 2010-2011)
This course will serve as an introduction to postcolonial African literatures, and it organizes a set of African novels, essays, and poetry around the concept of
revolution. In this course, we will attend to fiction that address pre-revolutionary, revolutionary, and post-revolutionary moments in various African societies. In
addition to representations of social/political revolutions (decolonization, civil war, feminism, etc.), this course will also consider literary ones (realism, postmod-
ernism, etc.). In doing so, we will consider a variety of questions: What is "revolutionary" literature? To what extent can a literary form be political/revolutionary?
What is the relationship between politics and aesthetics? Readings will likely include selections from among Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Njabulo Ndebele, Ama Ata
Aidoo, Bessie Head, Nuruddin Farah, Ayi Kwei Armah, Dambudzo Marechera, and Tsitsi Dangarembga.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon attendance and participation, reading responses, class presentations, one midterm essay, and one final
research paper.

AFR 160 Defining the African Diaspora (Same as Comparative Literature 214 and English 251) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered

What is the "African diaspora"? How are we to understand the nature of black belonging? Are the relationships across the African diaspora mutable? What
factors facilitate or complicate black identity over time and space? This introductory course will take up these questions by turning to (a) key figures and essays
and (b) the fiction, poetry, and film from across the black world. To help better understand the conditions of transnational black identity, we will turn to the work of
W.E.B. Du Bois, Kwame Nkrumah, Amie Cesaire, Paule Marshall, Toni Cade Bambara, Marcus Garvey, Frantz Fanon, Caryl Phillips, and Julie Dash, among
others. In the process, we will take up defining cultural and political movements that have emerged over the years: Pan-Africanism, Negritude, and other forms of
black internationalism.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon attendance and participation, two exams, and two essays.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15). Preference given to (potential) concentrators in Africana Studies.

AFR 180 Foundations of Afro-Caribbean Thought (Same as Political Science 206) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This course is an introduction to the foundations of Afro-Caribbean thought, a branch of study within the larger field of Africana thought. Africana thought
encompasses ideas from Africa, the Caribbean, North America, and other regions containing African Diasporic populations. In this class, we will examine the
contours of the Afro-Caribbean intellectual and political tradition by analyzing important historical figures and movements, the African philosophical roots of the
tradition, processes of enslavement and creolization, identity formation, nationalism, anti-colonialism, the role of gender, and the function of mass revolution. We
will discuss in particular two influential branches of thought outlined by Paget Henry in the seminal text Caliban's Reason: the poeticists and the historicists.
Afro-Caribbean thought distinguishes itself not only by its unique categories of poetic and historical knowledge production, but also by the collapse of barriers
between poetics and history in the domain of politics. Evaluating the moments of tension and symbiosis between the poeticist and historicst schools will allow us
to investigate further the tradition comprehensively. A key objective of the course is to provide students with the necessary preparation to engage in higher level
courses in this field of inquiry.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon attendance and participation, one 5- to 7-page midterm essay, class presentation, and one 10- to
12-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25. Preference given to first- and second-year students.

200-Level Courses
AFR 200(F) Introduction to Africana Studies
This survey course introduces students to the content and contours of Africana Studies as a field of study--its genealogy, development, and future challenges. The
course focuses on historic and contemporary experiences of African-descended peoples in the Americas, particularly the United States, the Caribbean, and Latin
America. We will also give some attention to how members of the Diaspora remember and encounter Africa, and to how Africans respond to the history of
enslavement, colonialism, apartheid, racism and globalization. In addition to literature and research, film, music, photography, and artwork will be used to devel-
op a critical understanding of the African Diaspora. These non-written texts will make abstract readings come to life while stimulating the development of critical
33
thinking skills. Students are encouraged to draw connections between these visual/audio representations and the ideas and issues that we uncover from course
readings.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon weekly 1-page reading response papers, two 5- to 7-page essays, and a final research project.
No prerequisites; open to all. No enrollment limit (expected 30).
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR BENSON and ROBERTS
AFR 202(S) Blackness 2.0: Race and New Technologies (Same as American Studies 202)
Media theorist and cultural critic Neil Postman poses a number of important questions about new technologies: what will the new technology do, what will it
undo? Who will be the winners and who will be the losers in any new technology? This course seeks to determine what people of color win and lose vis--vis new
technologies. How can we conceptualize the role of race in, ostensibly, a utopian race-less environment? Is there more to new media and race than assumptions
about a "digital divide"?
Course materials include secondary literature and qualitative research to explore how the racial discourse of the "real world" is (or isn't) reshaped and redefined in
the virtual world. Topics for discussion include: defining the "new" in new technologies; reproduction and reproductive capacities; queer science/transscience;
the politics of blogosphere; social networking and power; digital art; love Internet-style; designers, artists, and viewers; fandom; e-commerce and capitalism;
gamers and the virtual world; and convergence cultures of television and radio on the Internet.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on participation in the course's topical blog via Blackboard. The final research/practicum paper is on a topic related to
race and new media or race and new technologies. The practicum aspect will require an interactive component (e.g. short video, website, blog, podcast, etc.) in
which we use the theoretical elements of the course to reflect on our practice.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 19).

earlier jazz styles but his genius has given us music that is unique and meaningful to this day. In the early 1940's he and Charlie "Yardbird" Parker, Dizzy Gilles-
pie, Bud Powell, Max Roach and a thriving community of young, innovative musicians in New York developed this new style in places like Minton's Playhouse
in Harlem. They inspired a generation of musicians who continued their legacy and became iconic figures in the jazz world including Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins,
Charles Mingus, The Modern Jazz Quartet, Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. "Cool Jazz," "Hard Bop," and even "Free Jazz" and the Avante Garde of the
1960's emerged from the creative landscape that BeBop nurtured. This immense influence reached beyond music and into poetry and the arts. The Beat poet Jack
Kerouac idealized "Bird" and African-American poetry has been influenced by jazz from Langston Hughes to Amiri Baraka until today. BeBop and its offshoots
developed alongside the post-war Civil Rights movement. The give and take between the cultural and political development of Black America is an important
theme of this course--Jim Crow, integration, Civil Rights, Black Power, self-expression, improvisation, artistic, and political freedom. Readings include essays
and poetry that illustrate these influences as well as biographies of the major artists. With the introduction of any innovative art form, there can be an expected
backlash from the previous generation. We will read critical writings and reviews from the period that give us a better idea of the impact of this movement
including essays by Ralph Ellison. Listening will include jazz: weekly listening and reading assignmentswith a written journal, two short papers and one end of
semester 8-10 page research paper, midterm listening/short answer exam. Musicians may choose to substitute the research music from the 1930's until the pres-
ent.

offered 2010-2011)
Despite very significant historical differences, South African and the United States have undergone analogous periods of racial segregation and resistance. Such
recognizable symmetries have been amplified by writers/artists, which in turn has yielded fascinating cultural connections. This multi-genre course will trace the
emergence of a twentieth-century South African/African American cultural relationship by examining a variety of texts. Over the semester, we will examine the
patterns of influence between both populations in order to help us understand the role of cultural texts in the political arena (in particular, international solidarity
movements). In addition to comparative studies, we will examine literature and artistic works by Peter Abrahams, Richard Wright, Gwendolyn Brooks, Keora-
petse Kgositsile, Bessie Head, Audre Lorde, J.M. Coetzee, Gil Scott-Heron, and others.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon attendance and participation, reading responses, class presentations, one mid-term essay, and one final
research paper.
Prerequisites: Prior 100- or 200- level Africana Studies course or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to sophomores

AFR 302(S) Rastafari: Dread, Politics, Agency (Same as Political Science 234 and Religion 261)
The emergence of Rastafari in the twentieth-century marked a distinct phase in the theory and practice of political agency. From its heretical roots in Jamaica,
Garveyism, Ethiopianism, and Pan-Africanism, Rastafari has evolved from a Caribbean theological movement to an international political actor. This course
investigates the political theory of Rastafari in order to develop intellectual resources for theorizing the concept of agency in contemporary Africana thought and
political theory. We will analyze texts and audio-visual works on the political economy of late colonial Jamaica, core Rastafari thinking, political theology, the role
of reggae music, the notion of agency, and the influence of Rastafari on global politics.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based upon one 5- to 7-page midterm essay, a group lyrics and politics project, and one 8- to 10-page final exam.

This course will examine cultural representations of Africa in an effort to sharpen critical thinking and interpretive skills. Taking"Africa" as our focal point, we
will collectively consider key questions about representations: Who has the authority to define an "object" (i.e., Africa or Africans), and how is that authority
conferred? What motivates particular images and, more importantly, what are their effects? What role do particular assumptions or constructions of race play in
shaping culture? What is the relationship between a"simple" book or image and "the real world"? And what, finally, does it mean to make claims about an entire
continent? Our primary source material may include travel narratives, novels, journalism, and films that variously represent Africa. Along with some theoretical
essays on representation (including some by Stuart Hall, Roland Barthes, and W.J.T. Mitchell), primary texts may include Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Achebe's
Things Fall Apart, Dangarembga's Nervous Conditions, The Gods Must Be Crazy, Out of Africa, Guelwaar, Nightline's report "Heart of Darkness," the docu-
mentary Amandla!, and photographs of Darfur. Class will consist of lively class discussions and revision workshops.
Format: seminar. Assignments will include regular 1-page writing assignments, one final project, and two formal essays. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16).

Studies 400) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Physical or symbolic manipulation of space is one mode through which power operates, one manner in which power is exercised and experienced. Historically
and currently, space has been divided and resources have been unevenly distributed along numerous axes. Thus, we are left with a constellation of dubiously
constructed but nonetheless segregated spaces: public vs. private, male vs. female, white vs. black, native vs. immigrant, rich vs. poor, Christian vs. heathen (even
Protestant vs. Catholic), and straight vs. queer sexuality. In this senior seminar, we will examine the ways in which power is enacted, experienced, and resisted
through space. In particular, we will investigate the role of space in the creation of raced and gendered identities. Also, because the political and social manipula-
tion of space is not the exclusive prerogative of the empowered, we will consider ways that resisting communities have sought to negotiate, redesign, or redefine
space-or even transgress constrictive physical or social boundaries. Finally, we will inquire into the complex politics involved in attempts to establish alternative
spaces of relative autonomy beyond the rules or the space of dominant culture. Likely texts include but are not limited to: Henri LeFebvre's The Production of
Space, McKittrick and Woods' Black Geographies, Toni Morrison's Paradise, Phanswane Mpe's Welcome to Our Hillbrow, essays by Morrison, Michel de
Certeau, Neil Smith, bell hooks, David Harvey, Sarah Mills, among others.
Format: seminar. Evaluations will be based upon attendance and class discussion, regular short writing assignments, presentations, final projects, and one seminar
paper.
Enrollment limit: 14 (expected: 14). This seminar is open to all seniors, but priority will be given to Africana Studies concentrators.

AFR 402(F) The Political Thought of Frantz Fanon (Same as Philosophy 360 and Political Science 360)
Martinican psychiatrist, philosopher, and revolutionary Frantz Fanon was among the leading critical theorists and Africana thinkers of the twentieth-century.
Fanon ushered in the decolonial turn in critical theory, a move calling on those both within and outside of Europe to challenge the coloniality of the age and to
forge a new vision of politics in the postcolonial period. This course is an advanced seminar devoted to a comprehensive examination of Fanon's political thought.
We will begin with an analysis of primary texts by Fanon and end by considering how Fanon has been interpreted by his contemporaries as well as activists and
critical theorists writing today.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based upon attendance and participation, weekly 1-page reading response papers, a class presentation, and one 25-page final
research paper containing an abstract, keywords, text, and endnotes.
Prerequisites: open to Juniors and Seniors with a background in Africana Studies, political philosophy, and/or political theory (or permission of instructor). En-

Chair, Professor: MARK REINHARDT
Faculty 2009-2010: Professor: WONG. Associate Professors: L. JOHNSON, KENT. Assistant Professors: AUBERT, CEPEDA, RA, THORNE,
WANG*. Senior Lecturer: CLEGHORN. Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow: VIMALASSERY. Visiting Assistant Professor: UM.
GENERAL PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
The American Studies Program, an eleven-course major, uses interdisciplinary approaches to develop students' understanding of the complexity of the cul-
ture(s) usually labeled "American." Examining history, literature, visual media, performance, and other forms of expression, we explore the processes of cultural
definition as contested by diverse individuals and groups. We ask new questions about aspects of American life long taken for granted; we also use American
culture as a laboratory for testing classic and contemporary theories about how cultures work.
NON-MAJORS, FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS, AND SOPHOMORES
American Studies 201 is open to non-majors including first-year students. All elective courses are open to students who meet the requirements of the depart-
ments that sponsor those courses. Courses designated as junior or senior seminars are open to non-majors with permission of the instructor.
COURSES AND COURSE NUMBERING
American Studies offers courses at all levels. Our 100-level courses, which give preference to first-year students, explore a substantive topic in-depth without
seeking to introduce the field as a whole. Our introductory course, AMST 201, explores questions of American identity but also stresses the interdisciplinary
approach and diverse cultural artifacts that distinguish American Studies as a form of inquiry. Both this course and our occasional 200-level electives are ap-
propriate for students at all levels, including first-years. The intermediate courses, designated as Junior Seminars at the 300 level, are offered primarily for juniors,
although, when space permits, they are open to seniors and to sophomores who have had AMST 201. The 400-level courses designated as Senior Seminars are
designed for senior majors, though open to others with suitable preparation.
THE MAJOR
Required major courses:
American Studies 201
300 level courses designated Junior Seminar
400 level courses designated Senior Seminar
Elective courses:
Eight courses: five should be chosen from one of the specializations listed below, the other three chosen from among any of the electives listed, but
students must draw their remaining courses from two of the other specializations. Students are also required to take at least one course covering pre-1900
American history or culture.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN AMERICAN STUDIES
Candidates for honors in American Studies will undertake a substantial, year-long independent project during their Senior year. Applicants should have a
consistent record of high achievement in courses taken for the major, and normally will have done work in the field of study of their proposed thesis. Students who
wish to write or produce an honors project should consult with a prospective faculty advisor in their junior year. Formal application to pursue honors should be
made by the time of spring registration in the junior year. Students must submit a 1- to 2-page preliminary proposal describing the proposed project to the Chair of
the American Studies Program at this time. Final admission to the honors thesis program will depend on the AMST advisory committee's assessment of the
qualifications of the student and the merits and feasibility of the project. If the proposal is approved, they will be permitted to register for AMST 491, W30, and
AMST 492 the following year. The completed project is due in mid-April. Each student will present a short oral presentation of his or her thesis at the end of
spring semester. Honors Theses count as one of the eleven courses required for the major.
ADVISING
All majors will be assigned a faculty advisor. Majors must meet with their advisor during the first week of classes during the fall semester and at the time of the
spring semester registration period in order to have their courses and plans for the American Studies major approved. Both majors and non- majors are encour-
aged to talk at any time with the program chair or other affiliated faculty about the major.
AMERICAN STUDIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS
Students majoring in American Studies are encouraged to consider pursuing concentrations in Africana Studies, Environmental Studies, Latina/o Studies,
Performance Studies, and Women's and Gender Studies. Many of the courses counted for those concentrations may also earn credit toward the American Studies
major.
STUDY AWAY FROM WILLIAMS
We encourage students to pursue cross-cultural comparative studies. A major in American Studies can be combined with study away from Williams for a
semester or a year if plans are made carefully. Many courses that will be approved for College credit may also count toward the American Studies major if their
subject matter is American culture.
Students planning to be away in the junior year should have taken American Studies 201 before they leave; those away for one semester should take a Junior
Seminar in the semester they are on campus. Those away for the year should take a Junior Seminar in their sophomore year. Students should consult as early as
possible with the chair or their advisor about their plans for fulfilling the requirements of the major.

Gonzo journalism, the nonfiction novel, literary journalism, the "new new journalism." Before "American Studies" was named and developed as an academic
field the study of American culture thrived in the able hands of writers, reformers and amateur anthropologists whose works continue to form the basis of the
curriculum. This course is an introduction to American culture through the eyes of extraordinary writers who work as public intellectuals, addressing a readership
that reaches beyond the university. We will travel to Alaska with John McPhee, to Miami with Joan Didion, to Sing Sing prison with Ted Conover, and to the
Hmong community of Northern California with Ann Fadiman, examining at every stop both the cultures in which these acute observers immerse themselves and
their interpretive techniques. Works will be drawn from the following list of authors: Jane Addams, Zora Neal Hurston, Truman Capote, Hunter S. Thompson,
Tom Wolfe, Studs Terkel, John Edgar Wideman, Peggy Orenstein, Jon Krakauer, Susan Orlean, and Mitchell Duneier.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, and a combination of critical/analytical writing and creative nonfiction.

AMST 201(F,S) Introduction to American Studies (D)
To be an "American" means something more than U.S. citizenship. In this course, we focus on the problems and possibilities of American identity. Access to
Americanness is shaped by factors such as class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, and region--categories which themselves change in meaning over
time. Given the geographical, racial, and cultural diversity of the United States, the ways in which Americans imagine nation inevitably vary over time, according
to place, and among different individuals and groups. Rather than a survey of any one aspect or period of American history, literature, or popular culture, this
course is an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of American Studies, a field defined both by the range of texts we read (essays, novels, autobiographies,
photographs, films, music, architecture, historical documents, legal texts), and by the questions we ask of them: How have different Americans imagined what it
means to be an American? What ideas about national history, patriotism, and moral character shape their visions of Americanness? How do the educational
system, mass media, government policies regarding citizenship and immigration shape American identities? How are boundaries of inclusion and exclusion in
the nation drawn? What uses have been made of the claim to an American identity, and what is at stake in that claim? How have Americans imagined a national
37
landscape, a national culture, and to what ends?
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on a series of short critical essays and a group project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 per section (expected: 25 per section). Preference given to sophomores and first-year students with AP 5 in U.S. History.

How can we understand a society organized around controlling some people as private property, to be used and exchanged by other people? How does this relate
to a society organized around the universal individual ownership of commodities, and the value that arises from their use and exchange? Slavery is often under-
stood to precede capitalism in economic and social history. This course examines slavery and capitalism as mutually constitutive, one defining the other. In a
survey of scholarship theorizing the capitalism and slavery relationship, we will examine key questions of historical precedent and relationship between these
social systems, the place of slavery in analyses of capitalism, and, centrally, the struggles of enslaved people to contest their commodification, and the influence of
those struggles on life in capitalist society. This course will fulfill the Exploring Diversity Initiative, examining how the organization of power and privilege in
societies based on slavery continues to manifest in capitalism. Focusing on slavery and capitalism in the U.S., we will follow the lingering traces of slavery up to
the present day.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation and three review essays (5-7 pages each).

This course examines a sampling of Asian American texts from the late nineteenth century to the present and contextualizes them historically. Produced by
writers from various Asian American groups and in a variety of styles, these works by such writers as Maxine Hong Kingston, Jose Garcia Villa, Younghill Kang,
Hisaye Yamamoto, and Linh Dinh, provide a sense of heterogeneity of Asian American literature. They also force us to examine the intersections, material and
psychic, of historical events/larger structural forces with individuals and groups. Our readings will prod us to call into question assumptions we make about what
is "Asian American" but also, crucially, what is "American." Both domestic issues (e.g., American politics, racism, links with other minority groups) and global
considerations (e.g., U.S. immigration and foreign policies, the three wars with Asian countries in the last century)-and how they have shaped Asian American
histories and literatures-will figure importantly in our discussions.

AMST 302(F) Public Sphere/Public Space (Same as Political Science 335) (Junior Seminar) (W)
The "public sphere," one of the core concepts of modern democratic thought, has taken on renewed significance in intellectual life today. This writing-intensive
seminar looks briefly at the evolution of the term, but concentrates on its relevance to contemporary politics. Our investigations will center on the character and
meanings of public space. We will look at space both as a key metaphor in political theory and as a medium of everyday practical struggle: that is, we will examine
not only some of the most influential conceptions of public life, but also the political forces shaping and shaped by the practical design and use of the built
environment. These examinations will combine critical reading and analytical writing with field observations, group work, and oral presentations. Our primary
focus will be on the following topics: the relationship between ideas of citizenship and models of the public; the racing, gendering, and class-stratification of
spaces (civic, residential, commercial, etc.); urbanity and suburbanization; the kinds of spaces and politics opened and closed by the internet and contemporary
mass media; the effects of contemporary processes of globalization on political identity and democratic practices. Likely authors include Arendt, Berman, Davis,
Delany, Foucault, Fraser, Gamson, Habermas, Hall, Harvey, Holston, Sennett, Sunstein, Virilio.
Format: discussion. Requirements: regular participation in class and on line, one 3-page paper, three 6-page papers, and two ethnographic field exercises/presen-

and beyond, the momentum of expansion into the Pacific has catalyzed culture and politics in the U.S. This course examines the intertwined histories of the U.S.
and the Pacific, focusing on regions, nations, and empires. We will explore the ways that these regions constituted each other over the course of their shared
history, with an aim towards understanding the history of the U.S. as part of a larger history of the world. Through economic, diplomatic, military, cultural, and
38
community histories, we will consider encounters and contestations between the U.S. and the Pacific, to explore the shifting, contradictory emergence of ideas
and conceptions of "America."
Format: seminar/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly response papers, a cumulative review essay (5-7 pages), and a final paper
(10-15 pages).
No prerequisites. Expected enrollment: 10. Preference will be given to American Studies majors.

AMST 302 American Utopias (Junior Seminar) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
"The world is now too dangerous for anything less than Utopia," wrote Buckminster Fuller in the wake of WWII. Since the nation's founding Americans have
aspired toward a "promised land" or "good life" just beyond the reach of the real world. This junior seminar will focus on utopian thinking, social practices and
expressive arts. Reading in the fields of religion, literature, art, urban planning, music, education, film and sociology, we will consider the needs that give rise to
utopian visions and the strategies people have used to realize these imagined worlds. How may we account for the failures and successes of such experiments?
Among other topics, we will look at the nation-long history of millenarianism, culminating in Tim LaHaye's Left Behind novels, best-selling Christian literature
of the rapture and apocalypse. The class will take trips to sites of historical utopian communities and contemporary intentional communities. Authors include
Marx, Ann Lee, Thoreau, Wells-Barnett, Bellamy, Gilman, Garvey, Fuller, Samuel Delaney, David Harvey and Tour.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based up class participation and written assignments (including two 5-page papers and one 10- to 12-page final essay).
Prerequisites: American Studies 201. Enrollment limited to junior American Studies majors and to those American Studies majors will be or have been away
during their junior year.

(Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (D)
The recent fascination with all things "diasporic," "global," "transnational," and "cosmopolitan" has shifted the emphasis away from conceiving of ethnic litera-
tures solely, or primarily, as sub-categories of national literatures. A focus on "horizontal" rather than "vertical" ties re-frames our thinking about minority litera-
ture while also raising new issues. For example, what exactly is shared by subjects in a given diaspora? Does the term "diaspora" necessarily invoke the specter of
racial essentialism? What happens to the category of race when one moves away from local politics? Is the idea of a diasporic subject much less vexing than the
idea of, say, a racially minoritized person? How important a role does the shared English language play in these diasporas? In this course, we will look at the
works of a specific diasporic literary group--English-language Chinese writers (in this case, Chiang Yee, Louis Chu, Chuang Hua , Evelyn Lau, Shirley G. Lim,
Pamela Lu, Alvin Lu, Timothy Mo, Fred Wah, Ouyang Yu)--as a means to think about the nature of the "diasporic" and the "global." We will focus on two types
of sites: 1) geographic--mostly cities and urban areas: San Francisco, NYC, Taipei, Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, London, Vancouver, etc.--which function as
material spaces and places of the imagination, and 2) linguistic--i.e., the space of the English language.
Format: discussion/seminar. Evaluation will be based on one 5- to 7-page paper, one 8- to 10-page paper, short response papers, participation.
Prerequisites: those taking this as an English class must have previously taken a 100-level English course. Enrollment limit: 17 (expected: 10). Preference given to

AMST 332(S) Latinos and Education: The Politics of Schooling, Language, and Latino Studies (Same as Latina/o Studies 332) (Junior
Seminar) (W) (D)
Schools have often become the focal point for debates over the relationship between cultural identity, intellectual abilities, and the production of knowledge. What
should be taught, who should be taught, and how they should be taught frame the politics of schooling. Language has often taken center stage in these debates.
This course examines the effects of educational policies and practices on the development of Latina/o students and communities. We will also consider how these
students and communities have resourcefully carved out spaces and made demands to meet their educational needs. Topics include school desegregation, bilin-
gual education, student walk-outs and sit-ins, as well as the origins and advancement of Chicano Studies, Puerto Rican Studies, and more recently Latino Studies
programs on college campuses. Students will critically engage the major themes of the course in two essays as they also engage each other in the form of peer-re-
views and other in-class writing workshop exercises. This course explores the experiences and expressions of racially and culturally diverse Latinas and Latinos,
focusing on the myriad ways in which they confront, negotiate, and at times challenge dominant U.S. hierarchies of race, culture, gender and class.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, writing workshop participation (and related assignments), group presentations, and two es-
says (12-15 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12). Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators.

Comparative Literature 375, English 375 and Latina/o Studies 403) (Not offered 2009-2010) (D)
Critics reading minority writing often focus on its thematic--i.e., sociological-content. Such literature is usually presumed to be inseparable from the "identi-
ty"/body of the writer and read as autobiographical, ethnographic, representational, exotic. At the other end of the spectrum, avant-garde writing is seen to concern
itself "purely" with formal questions, divorced from the socio-historical (and certainly not sullied by the taint of race). In the critical realm we currently inhabit, in
which "race" is opposed to the "avant-garde," an experimental minority writer can indeed seem an oxymoron. In this class we will closely read recent work by
Asian American, African American, Native American and Latino/a writers which challenges preconceptions about ethnic literature, avant-garde writing, genre
categorization, among other things. The writing done by these mostly young, mostly urban, poets and fiction writers is some of the most exciting being written in
the United States today; their texts push the boundaries of aesthetic form while simultaneously engaging questions of culture, politics, and history. Reading them
forces us to re-think our received notions about literature. Authors to be read include Renee Gladman, John Keene, Ed Roberson, Amiri Baraka, Linh Dinh,
Bhanu Kapil, Charles Yu, Paola Javier, James Thomas Stevens, and Edwin Torres.
Format: seminar/discussion. Evaluation will be based on either one 16- to 18-page seminar paper or two shorter papers (one 7-8 pages and one 9-10 pages); short
response papers; participation.
Prerequisites: Those taking this as an English class must have previously taken a 100-level English course. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Preference given

AMST 403 American Music (Senior Seminar) (Not offered 2009-2010)
One way to write the cultural history of music is to trace the authority with which different people can say "You are hurting my ears' at any given historical
moment." So writes Carlo Rotella, one of the historians whose work we will read in this course as we approach American popular music as an object of cultural
studies. We will study particular performers and styles (e.g. Elvis, Selena, punk and hip hop), but we do so in the context of the histories of labor; social migration;
political and economic shifts; ideologies; and of the culture industry. Moving from the late-nineteenth-century to the present, and through agrarian to industrial to
postindustrial social configurations, we will study music as a means of expressing resistance and accommodation and as the basis of community-formation and
disruption. We will pay special attention to the recent recovery by American musicians of folk musics originating outside of American borders: Celtic, African
and Cuban in the context of global capitalism and American hegemony. Texts include works of history, cultural criticism and ethnomusicology; audio perfor-
mance recorded in the field, in the studio, and in concert; and documentary and fiction films.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on a number of written assignments.
Prerequisites: prior work in American Studies. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to senior American Studies majors.

405) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Senior Seminar) (W) (D)
The metaphor of "home" and idea of "belonging" bring insight to theories and investigations centered on community building and identity formation within and
across national borders. These constructions give us an indication of what people value, what is worth fighting for, as well as what is considered expendable. Our
objective in this course is to interrogate constructions of home and belonging by studying how individuals, communities, and nations are transformed by experi-
ences of dislocation, migration, and renewed place-making. What are the ways a sense of belonging shapes these identities and the investments made in these
formations? Working with ethnography, history, memoir, literature, critical essays, and documentary film, we will consider the personal and political uses and
meanings of memory, nostalgia, and imagination in "rooting" migrating subjects in place and time. Among the many case studies we will examine are the politics
of homeland among Cuban-Americans, Native American and West Indian festive forms, and place-claiming and racial sincerity among African Americans. This
course explores the experiences and expressions of racialized populations in the United States, focusing on the myriad ways in which they confront, negotiate, and
at times challenge dominant U.S. hierarchies of race, culture, gender and class.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, annotated bibliography, short essay, writing workshop participation (and related assignments),
research paper related assignments, and a final research paper and presentation.
Prerequisites: Prior courses in Latino Studies, American Studies, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 15). Preference given to senior Latino

AMST 407(F) Imperialism and the United States (Senior Seminar) (Same as History 369) (D)
In recent years, the U.S. has become involved in explicitly imperial projects around the world, engendering debate across the political spectrum over the proper
role of imperialism in U.S. domestic and foreign policy. This course will explore this debate in historical depth, in order to specify the concept of "American
Imperialism," and to clarify the stakes of arguments between national citizens and imperial subjects. We will examine imperial tendencies of the U.S., as well as
encounters with other empires, in a broad historical survey, from the colonial period to the recent past. Our aim is an understanding of how the United States has
emerged historically through ecological, economic, political, and cultural exchanges within a framework of inter-imperial conflict. Foregrounding the U.S. in a
world historical context, we will consider the domestic history of the U.S. as it has been shaped through encounters across political and cultural borders. This
course will fulfill the Exploring Diversity Initiative, with a comparative study of imperial cultures that have interacted with the U.S., not only enriching our
cultural awareness and understanding, but also shining a light on aspects of U.S. culture that are often hidden and invisible.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly response papers, a cumulative review essay (5-7 pages), and a final paper (10-15
pages).

AMST 409(S) Tracing the Roots of Routes: Comparative Transnationalisms (Senior Seminar) (Same as Latina/o Studies 409) (W) (D)
In the age of satellite television, e-mail, and readily available international phone cards, transnationalism has rapidly become the norm as opposed to the excep-
tion. However, what does it really mean to "be transnational"? How do the lived experiences of transnational individuals and communities merge with (and differ
from) theoretical notions of the transnational? How do the practices and concepts of diaspora, globalization, and transnationalism overlap? How does the growing
number of transnational citizens and residents in this country shape "American" identity on the local, national, and global scales? In this interdisciplinary, compar-
ative course we will analyze contemporary theories regarding the origins and impacts of transnationalism, key critiques regarding the field of transnational studies
itself, and transnationalism's role in the "New" American Studies. Case studies examined in this course include China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Haiti,
India, Mexico and the Philippines.
Format: discussion. Evaluation to be based on student participation, the completion of an original research paper conducted in stages (abstract, annotated bibliog-

SPECIALIZATION FIELDS
To provide focus for work in the major, each student will choose one of the Specialization Fields listed below and record this choice when registering for the
major. (This commitment can be revised, in consultation with the chair.) At least five electives will be taken from among those designated to support a specializa-
tion field. In extraordinary cases, students who wish to do so may be permitted to design their own specialization field. All such arrangements must be approved
by the American Studies Advisory Committee.
ARTS IN CONTEXT
This specialization is for students interested in American arts, literature and media. Its approaches are interdisciplinary: it trains students to examine cultural
artifacts with attention to aesthetic form and to the contexts--historical, social, political--that determine and situate those forms. Broadly, it asks how history has
40
shaped the arts and media and how the arts and media have shaped how we think and who we are. Students in this specialization take courses across a range of
genres and media: poetry, fiction, music, film and video, pop culture, visual culture, performance, experimental and activist art.
Students can check with the program chair to see if other courses not listed here might count as electives.

ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor JAMES NOLAN
Professors: M. F. BROWN, D. EDWARDS, JACKALL*, JUST, NOLAN. Associate Professors: FOIAS*. Assistant Professors: SHEVCHENKO,
VALIANI**. Lecturer: GUTSCHOW.
The Department of Anthropology and Sociology at Williams aims to help students achieve an integrated understanding of biography, history, culture, and
social structure in both traditional and modern societies.
Anthropology explores the full range of human experience by introducing students to the study of tribal and peasant societies, especially those on the periphery
of the West, as well as to the cultural complexities of stratified, industrial societies such as our own. Integrated with the study of specific peoples is an examination
of the various analytical schemes anthropologists have developed to understand them. Courses offered in the department represent two of Anthropology's major
subfields: sociocultural anthropology--that is, the comparative study of human social life, institutions, and beliefs--and archaeology, the study of the origins and
lifeways of prehistoric peoples.
Sociology studies the social and institutional intricacies of modern industrial societies and the social psychological dilemmas facing the individual in our
epoch. Sociology courses introduce students to classical and contemporary social thought about men and women and society, to the systematic analysis of social
institutions and social interaction, and to the social analysis of modern culture. The Sociology major at Williams emphasizes the humanistic tradition of sociology,
stressing qualitative approaches to understanding how social reality is constructed.
MAJORS
The department offers separate majors in both Anthropology and Sociology, with a broad and diverse array of courses in both disciplines. The department is
committed, however, to the unity of the social sciences. To this end, Anthropology and Sociology offer joint core courses in methodology and theory, as well as
several elective courses in common. All joint courses are designated "ANSO."
Requirements
For the degree in Anthropology or Sociology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses as outlined below:
(1) Core Courses. Majors in both disciplines must take a sequence of four core courses. Three of these are joint (ANSO) courses. We strongly encourage
students to take ANSO 205 and 206 during their sophomore year. The sequences are:
Anthropology Joint (ANSO) Sociology
ANTH 101 The Scope SOC 101 Invitation to
of Anthropology Sociology
ANSO 205
Ways of Knowing
ANSO 206
Social Theory
ANSO 402
Senior Seminar
(2) Elective Courses. Majors in Anthropology or Sociology must take five elective courses from the course listings of their respective disciplines or from
the joint ANSO listings. Two of the courses chosen are normally at the 300 level or above. In close consultation with their departmental advisors, students
may take some selected courses from other disciplines to fulfill major requirements in either Anthropology or Sociology.
(3) Majors in each wing of the department are allowed to count up to two courses in the other wing towards fulfillment of their major requirements.
STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS
In addition to the nine total courses required for the major, it is recommended that Anthropology and Sociology majors take Statistics 101 or a comparable
course in statistics and data analysis.
AREA STUDIES CONCENTRATION
Students who wish to combine a major in Anthropology or Sociology with an Area Studies concentration are encouraged to do so. Courses taken to satisfy an
Area Studies requirement may be counted toward the major with prior approval of a student's departmental advisor. The only exception to this rule is the Area
Studies senior seminar, which cannot ordinarily be counted toward the Anthropology or Sociology degree.
LANGUAGE STUDY, STUDY ABROAD, AND WINTER STUDY
Departmental advisors will help interested students integrate a major with study abroad, foreign language study, or field research during the winter study
period. The department encourages Williams students to take advantage of established foreign study programs in Egypt, Japan, India, Hong Kong, and other
countries. Because some foreign study programs do not offer courses that can be counted toward the Anthropology or Sociology degrees, however, sophomores
planning to study abroad in junior year must consult with the departmental advisor before declaring a major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ANTHROPOLOGY OR SOCIOLOGY
Honors and highest honors are normally awarded for the completion of a year-long research project that has resulted in an original thesis of high quality.
Students wishing to write an honors thesis should engage a member of the department faculty as a Thesis Advisor as soon as possible and must submit a proposal
for the thesis for department approval no later than preregistration in the spring of the junior year. If the proposal is approved, they will be permitted to register for
Anthropology and Sociology 493-W31-494, during which they will write and defend a thesis. If their overall work in the major continues to be of high quality and
the thesis is deemed of a similar quality, they may be awarded honors or highest honors in Anthropology or Sociology.
ANTHROPOLOGY / SOCIOLOGY COURSES
JOINT CORE COURSES
ANSO 205(S) Ways of Knowing
This class is an exploration of how one makes sense of the social world through fieldwork. Some of the key questions of the course are: What are the philosophi-
cal and epistemological underpinnings of social inquiry? How does one frame intellectual problems and go about collecting, sifting, and assessing field materials?
What sets social reality apart from nature, and what implications does this difference have for our study of society? What are the uses and limits of statistical data?
What is the importance of history to sociological and anthropological research? How can one use archival and other documentary materials to enrich ethnograph-
ic research? What are the empirical limits to interpretation? What is the relationship between empirical data and the generation of social theory? How does the
social organization of social research affect one's inquiry? What are the typical ethical dilemmas of fieldwork and of other kinds of social research? How do
researchers' personal biographies and values shape their work? We will approach these problems concretely rather than abstractly through a series of case studies,
drawing upon the field experiences of departmental faculty and visitors who represent a variety of research methods and disciplinary perspectives.
Format: seminar. Requirements: a series of short papers and a take-home final exam.
Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25).
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W NOLAN
ANSO 206(F) (formerly 305) Social Theory
An introduction to social theory in anthropology and sociology, with strong emphasis on enduring works by major thinkers--Marx, Weber, Durkheim, and
Freud, among others--who have shaped views of society in the West and beyond. Several key questions inform exploration of these works: What are the histori-
cal roots and principal attributes of modernity? From the perspective of modernity, how do social theorists understand "the primitive"? Do society and culture
have organizing rules? What role does human agency play in the unfolding of social life? What are the possibilities and limits of scientific approaches to the study
of human social experience? In considering such questions, we will reconstruct the intellectual and social histories of both disciplines, examining in particular
how they abandoned common ground and language, with sociologists gravitating toward paradigms of scientific predictability and anthropologists toward rela-
tivistic frameworks of interpretation. Finally, we will examine the migration of ideas from anthropology and sociology to other disciplines and back again. The
course emphasizes major differences between interpretive frameworks as well as common elements that contribute to a deeper understanding of the social world.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three 5- to 7-page essays.
Prerequisites: Anthropology 101 or Sociology 101 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15).
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF M. F. BROWN
ANSO 402(S) Senior Seminar (Same as Anthropology 402 and Sociology 402)
This capstone seminar combines intensive discussion and individual research. The first half of the semester will be dedicated to the discussion of a social issue
central to the concerns of both anthropology and sociology. The class will meet with the instructor in spring 2010 to decide on that topic. Then, in the second half
44
of the semester, students will pursue independent, original projects and produce a major term paper. Toward the end of the semester, students will present their
projects to the seminar. Students who are not senior majors in anthropology or sociology are admitted to this course only on the instructor's permission.
Format: seminar. Requirements: full participation, major research project and paper, class presentation.
Prerequisites: senior Anthropology and Sociology majors or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 15).
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR D. EDWARDS
ANTHROPOLOGY COURSES
ANTH 101(F,S) The Scope of Anthropology (D)
Is there such a thing as "human nature"? Why have human societies developed such a bewildering range of customs to deal with problems common to people
everywhere? This course addresses these questions by introducing students to the comparative study of human social life and culture. Topics surveyed in the
course include economics, language and thought, kinship and marriage, law and politics, and the wide variations in human belief systems, including religions.
The course also considers the ways that anthropology, a discipline that was until recently practiced almost exclusively by Westerners, approaches other societies
in search of insights on our own customs and values. Ethnographic descriptions of both "simple" tribal societies and complex modern ones are a prominent part of
the readings. This course explores differences and similarities between cultures and societies and ways in which they have interacted and responded to one
another in the past.
Format: lecture/discussion of case studies and ethnographic films. Requirements: two short essays, a final examination and class participation.
Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores. Juniors and seniors admitted only by permission of instructor.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR First Semester: JUST
11:00-12:15 MWF Second Semester: JUST
ANTH 102 Human Evolution: Down From the Trees, Out to the Stars (Same as Environmental Studies 106) (Not offered 2009-2010; to
be offered 2010-2011)
One important way of understanding what it means to be a human being is to see humankind as an evolving biological species. This course traces the story of our
evolution, in terms of both the fossil evidence of our anatomical evolution and the archaeological, primatological, and conjectural evidence for the evolution of
human behavior. We will trace five million years of human (and near-human) history as our ancestors are transformed from creatures of the forest canopy to
upright scavengers of the African plains, to the fire-using species that burst out of Africa and spread across the globe, to the cold-adapted Neanderthals, to the
anatomically modern humans whose ability to manipulate symbolic communication has placed footprints on the moon while bringing us to the verge of self-de-
struction.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: research paper, two quizzes, two exams, group presentations.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 30). Preference will be given to first- and second-year students.
FOIAS
ANTH 103 Pyramids, Bones, and Sherds: What is Archaeology? (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Anthropology examines not only living societies, but also prehistoric cultures whose remains are found worldwide. This course will present how archaeology
examines the various aspects of human society from the physical record of prehistory. How do we study the subsistence and settlement patterns, the political and
social organization, and the economy and ideology of prehistoric societies who have left behind mute material records? The objective of anthropological archae-
ology is to bring to life these prehistoric cultures through archaeological analysis. The different goals, approaches and methodologies of modern archaeology will
be discussed theoretically and then applied to case studies.
Format: lecture/discussion/class presentations of case studies. Requirements: class presentations, two papers, midterm and final exams.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 25).

ANTH 214 The Rise and Fall of Civilizations (Same as Environmental Studies 224) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Over the centuries, philosophers and historians have asked how societies evolved from simple hunter-gatherer bands to complex urban civilizations. Human
prehistory and history have shown the repeated cycles of the rise, expansion and collapse of early civilizations in both the Old and New World. What do the
similarities and differences in the development of these first civilizations tell us about the nature of societal change, civilization and the state, and human society
itself? The course will examine these issues through an introductory survey of the earliest civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, Mesoamerica and South
America. Classical and modern theories on the nature, origin, and development of the state will be reviewed in light of the archaeological evidence.
Format: lecture/class discussion. Requirements: midterm, final exam, paper, two quizzes.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 35).
FOIAS
ANTH 215 The Secrets of Ancient Peru: Archaeology of South America (Not offered 2009-2010)
The Spanish Conquest of South America in the sixteenth century presented a new and alien world to the Western societies. The various civilizations from the
earliest Chavin culture to the latest Inca empire were generally misunderstood by the Spanish conquistadores. This introductory course will present a review of
the nature of the sociopolitical, economic, and ideological aspects of the various Latin-American cultures of South America in light of the archaeological sites,
artifacts, art and earliest historical texts.
Format: lecture/films/class debates. Requirements: midterm, final exam, and 10-page research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40.
FOIAS
ANTH 216(S) Indigenous Peoples of Latin America
An introduction to the indigenous cultural heritage of Central and South America. After a brief review of Latin-American prehistory, the course will consider such
issues as the demographic and political impact of the Conquest; the economic, social, and religious life of contemporary Indian and peasant communities; and the
dynamics of cultural redefinition and survival in the turbulent political arena of the modern Latin-American state.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two essays and a take-home exam.
No prerequisites. Open to first-year students. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25).

(See under CHIN 223 for full description.) YU
ANTH 225(S) Visible Culture: Documentary and Nonfiction (Same as English 303)
This course examines the potential of moving images to reveal aspects of culture normally obscured by the written word. We will consider both the theory and
practice of documentary film from its inception around 1900 to the present, paying particular attention to the way documentary filmmakers have approached the
representation of social reality in Western and non-Western cultural settings. Questions that we will consider include: What is the relationship between written text
and image, or between image and story? What is the role of film in anthropology? What counts as a document?
Team-taught, through a mixture of lectures and discussions. Course requirement: Regular attendance at film screenings and active class participation. Students
will write a 5-page paper on an assigned topic and a 12- to 15-page final paper. There will be a self-scheduled take-home final.
Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to Anthropology/Sociology majors, then to sophomores, and finally to first-year students.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR D. EDWARDS
ANTH 233(S) Spiritual Crossroads: Religious Life in Southeast Asia (Same as Asian Studies 233 and Religion 249) (D)
No region of the world presents a richer tapestry of religious beliefs, practices, and institutions than Southeast Asia. Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam
are all to be found and all of them interpenetrate and contend with each other and with a deep undergirding of animism, shamanism, and mystical folk belief
systems. This course will survey these religious traditions through time and space, looking in particular at the growing tension between religion and the state as
fundamentalism and religious militancy have spread into the region in recent times. All of Southeast Asia will be covered, but particular attention will be devoted
to Indonesia, where religious blending and the growth of new fundamentalism are both especially marked.
Format: seminar. Requirements: mid-term, short essays, term paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Open to non-majors.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR JUST
ANTH 243(F) Dilemmas of Humanitarian Intervention (W)
This course will explore the promises, realities, and implications of humanitarian interventions, including relief operations, national reconstruction projects, and
peacekeeping missions. People in the affluent nations of Western Europe and North America contribute billions of dollars each year in response to solicitations
45
promising to relieve the suffering of victims of natural disaster, political strife, ethnic cleansing, and refugee crises. Western governments send thousands of troops
to war-torn nations in order to "keep the peace." However, all too often these efforts go awry and contribute in direct and indirect ways to the natural, economic,
and political destruction already visited upon these countries. This course will consider the reasons and ways in which often well-intentioned actions to relieve the
suffering of others go wrong, and ways in which current efforts might be improved. The course will begin with a consideration of the philosophical, ethical, and
social underpinnings of humanitarianism, and then examine several classic anthropological studies, including Marcel Mauss's The Gift, which provide the ground
for considering humanitarianism in a more socially nuanced manner. The majority of the course will focus on specific case studies or relief, reconstruction, and
peacekeeping operations, including famine relief in sub-Saharan Africa, peacekeeping in the Balkans, and reconstruction programs in Afghanistan. In addition,
we will look in depth at the work of one or more aid organizations.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two short papers (2-3 pages), a longer research paper (7 pages), and a take-home final.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). The class is open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Preference given to Anthropology and Sociology
majors.

ANTH 257(S) Gender Remade: Muslim Women and Narratives of Subjection (Same as Religion 238 and Women's and Gender Studies 257)
The question of women's status in Muslim societies has been posed as a moral problem since the colonial era providing much of the impetus for political and
social reform as a corrective to the perceived conditions of women's subjugation. This course will consider the ways in which this problem has been defined at the
intersections of competing discourses (liberal humanist, nationalist, and religious) to understand how these have shaped gender in Muslim societies in the colonial
and post-colonial periods. We will critically engage with a range of textual genres--including histories, ethnographies, biographies, memoirs--relating to gender
in Muslim societies in order to explore the contours of these debates in the colonial and postcolonial periods. By considering the theoretical and methodological
issues posed by feminist, post-structuralist and postcolonial theorists in the study of gender and 'women in the third world', we will examine the ways in which
categories such as religious, secular, human, political and social are variously deployed to represent beliefs, practices, conditions and lives of Muslim women.
While the course is not geographically specific, it will primarily draw upon historical and anthropological literatures of the Middle East and South Asia. A famil-
iarity with gender and Islam is recommended though not considered necessary to take this course.
Format: seminar (with occasional mini-lectures). Requirements: full class participation and attendance, class presentations, quiz, two 5-page papers and a take-
home final.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Open to all students, but preference given to Anthropology and Sociology majors.

ANTH 272(F) (formerly 392) Sex in Society: Cultural Constructions of Reproduction (Same as Religion 272 and Women's and Gender Studies
272)
Why is reproduction such a controversial subject in medicine as well as religious and cultural discourses more broadly? And why is the reproductive body subject
to such highly ideological and yet contradictory types of practices across the globe? This course seeks to examine the myriad ways that societies police the range
of practices surrounding reproduction---including fertility, conception, pregnancy, birth, abortion, and motherhood. The class will pursue a comparative analysis
of reproduction across major cultures and religions, as well as a deeper understanding of specialized topics such as the new reproductive technologies, the medi-
calization and ritualization of obstetrics in America, the continuing controversies over abortion across the globe, and the fracas over motherhood in the US popu-
larly dubbed the 'Mommy Wars'. Throughout the course, we remain focused on the cultural, social, and medical construction of birth and reproduction more
generally. To this end, we explore the varying ritual and medical practices that surround birth in different cultural contexts, from high tech to low tech settings and
societies. We will deconstruct the process of human reproduction through readings culled from a variety of cultures and disciplines including anthropology,
medicine, religious studies, sociology, and women's studies. By the end of the course, we will appreciate how and why reproduction in such a contentious issue
today.
Format: seminar. Requirements: participation in a weekly class blog, course presentations, final papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected 25). Preference given to seniors and majors in Anthropology, Sociology, Religion, and Women's and Gender
Studies.

ANTH 324 Empires of Antiquity (Not offered 2009-2010)(W)
Cycles of rise and collapse of civilizations are common in our human past. Among the most fascinating cases are those of empires, conquest civilizations, or states
that encompass a number of different ethnicities, polities and peoples. However, their rise and often rapid collapse begs an important question: how stable have
empires been in human prehistory? Are they intrinsically unstable political forms? The course will address these questions by examining the major empires of the
Old and New World in pre-modern history: Persian; Assyrian; Mongol; Roman; Chinese; Ottoman; Aztec; and Inca empires. Using readings by political scien-
tists, historians, epigraphers, archaeologists and political anthropologists, we will consider the causes of the expansion and collapse of these empires. We will also
explore their sociopolitical and economic structures as mechanisms for their maintenance in order to provide a cross-cultural comparison of the differential suc-
cess and final decline of all these empires.
Format: seminar. Requirements: weekly short response papers and a research paper, class presentation and participation.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 15). Open to first-year students.
FOIAS
ANTH 328T Emotions and the Self (Not offered 2009-2010) (D) (W)
Everyone everywhere experiences emotions, and everyone everywhere is faced with the task of conceptualizing a self-hood and its place in the social world. This
course analyzes a variety of recent attempts in the social sciences to come to grips with topics that have long been avoided: the nature of the interior experience
and an epistemological framework for its cross-cultural comparison. Exploring the borderlands between anthropology, sociology, and psychology, we will bring
the tools of ethnographic analysis to bear on central pan-human concepts: emotions and the self. By examining these phenomena as they occur in other cultures,
we will be better placed to apprehend and challenge the implicit (and often unconsciously held) assumptions about emotions and the self in our own culture, both
in daily life and in academic psychological theory. What are emotions? Are they things--neuro-physiological states--or ideas--sociocultural constructions?
How are they to be described; compared? What is the self? How are selves constructed and constituted? How do various cultures respond to categories of emotion
and self, and how can we develop a sense of the relationship between self and emotion?
Format: tutorial.
Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Open to first-year students.

Beliefs in magic, malign and otherwise, have been nearly universal in human experience. This course examines these beliefs in an attempt to understand their
cognitive basis, symbolic effectiveness, and social consequences. In particular we will approach the question of "magical thinking": is magical thought "mistaken
science" or a universal non-rational way of seeing the world? What does the fact of presumably rational people holding apparently irrational beliefs say about the
whole idea of rationality? Are witches self-aware agents who believe in the malign magic they practice, or are they innocent, marginalized victims of hegemonic
powers? To answer these and other questions we will draw on case studies from a broad range of ethnographic and historic sources, including Aguaruna love
magic, Azande oracles, Voodoo in Brooklyn, and witches in Renaissance Italy and twentieth-century England.

ANTH 342 Dispute and Conflict, Settlement and Resolution: The Anthropology of Law (Not offered 2009-2010)
How does a society define the moral life and by what means does it resolve the internal conflicts that inevitably arise? These questions are approached through a
survey of the anthropology of law in the broad sense, as concerned not just with codified laws and formal institutions, but with all forms of dispute settlement and
conflict resolution, including mediation and arbitration. Taking an ethnographic and cross-cultural perspective, we will examine the cultural construction of dis-
46
pute, the nature of evidence, and the variety of processes by which disputes can be resolved. We will further examine the relationship between the scale of a
community and its legal mechanisms, with particular attention to plural legal systems and the tension between customary and national law in modernizing na-
tions. Ultimately we will try to come to grips with the question of justice: its definition and the means by which it may be achieved.

ANTH 347(F) Tribe and State on the Afghan-Pakistan Border
One of the major challenges President Obama will face in his first term in office involves the perilous situation on the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
While the problems in the region are generally framed in relation to Islamic extremism, the more fundamental issue is the failure of the Afghan and Pakistani
governments to exercise control over the tribes that occupy the mountainous frontier. This course will look first at the history of the Afghan and Pakistani states
and of the Pushtun and Baluchi tribes that are part of, yet independent from the states that surround them. We will go on to consider the role of Islam as a political
force in the region, with particular emphasis on the ways in which outside religious groups, most recently al-Qaeda, have managed to gain a foothold in the
borderlands, despite the historic resistance of the tribes to outsiders of any kind. The course will also examine the efforts of, first, the Soviet Union in the 1980s
and, more recently, the United States and its allies to control the borderlands, and we will conclude with a consideration of the geopolitical implications if Afghan-
istan and Pakistan prove in the end to be "failed states." Readings will include theoretical discussions of tribe/state relations, British and Soviet era accounts of the
frontier (non-fiction and fiction), ethnographies of tribal societies, and contemporary studies.

ANTH 364T Ritual, Politics, and Power (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
Power is distributed unequally in society, and one of the main avenues by which this distribution comes about and is maintained is through ritual. History tells us
that power is nothing until it is ritualized, for it is only through ritual means that power can be concentrated, maintained, and transmitted. At the same time, the
converse is also true. For those contesting the way power is distributed in society, ritual provides a necessary weapon for mobilizing support and undermining the
legitimacy of those in charge. This course looks at the relationship between ritual, politics and power from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and in a number
of different socio-cultural contexts. Beginning with the ethological and psychological study of ritual, we will consider some of the ways in which anthropologists
and sociologists in particular have examined ritual's role in society, as well as the elementary forms of political ritual, such as rites of passage, sacrifice, and
kingship. We will investigate the extent to which rituals are similar in `traditional' and `modern' contexts. We will also examine the role ritual plays in political
resistance and the question of whether and in what circumstances rituals are subversive or constitutive of the dominant structures of authority.

ANTH 391(F) Insurgencies: Revolts, Revolutions, Wars of National Liberation, and Jihads (Same as History 391 and INTR 391)
We often tend to think of warfare in the classic terms described by Clausewitz: states waging armed conflict against other states using uniformed armed forces that
are distinct from non-combatant civilian populations. Throughout history, however, we may also encounter many instances of asymmetric conflict within states,
colonies, and other political entities, involving combatants who are often indistinguishable from the general population and whose objectives are often unlike
those of states: Peasant revolts, revolutions, wars of independence or national liberation, and other forms of resistance and civil insurgency pit the relatively weak
against the power of the state and may succeed because, to use Mao's metaphor, the insurgents move among the people like fish in water. The close relationship
between insurgent fighters and the supporting population makes the social structure, social values, social institutions-in short, the culture-of the society particular-
ly relevant to understanding the nature of a given asymmetric conflict. In this course we will use theoretical and analytical concepts from anthropology, sociology,
history, and political philosophy to examine asymmetric conflicts of the twentieth century and the present day. The course will be divided into three parts: in the
first we will explore some of the theoretical literature on violence and warfare as well as some of the basic literature on tribal and peasant society, peasant revolts,
wars of national liberation, guerilla warfare, and insurgencies. The second part of the course will be devoted to presentations prepared by small groups of students
on case studies, e.g., the Hukbalahap insurgency in the Philippines, the communist revolutions of China, Cuba, and Malaysia, wars of national liberation such as
those in Algeria and Vietnam, and other ongoing civil conflicts such as the Palestinian intifadah and "ethnic cleansing" in the Balkans. The final portion of the
course is devoted to an in-depth study of Iraq following the American invasion and to a consideration of the evolving nature of asymmetric conflict in a globaliz-
ing world.

SOC 202 Terrorism and National Security (Not offered 2009-2010)
An analysis of the roots, goals, and social organization of contemporary radical Islamist terrorism and of the state efforts to defeat it. A focus on: the recruitment,
training, and indoctrination of Islamist terrorists; their ideologies and self-images; and case studies of specific terrorist attacks and the vulnerabilities of modern
societies that such attacks reveal. The course analyzes the exigencies and dilemmas of ensuring public safety in a democratic society. Special attention to: the
structure and ethos of intelligence work; the investigation of terrorist networks and their financing; the relationship between organized and semi-organized crime
and terrorism; the legal dilemmas of surveillance, preemptive custody, and "extraordinary rendition" in democratic societies; and the technology and organization
of ascertaining identities in modern society. The course also addresses the crisis facing European societies-particularly the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the
Netherlands, and Germany- with growing populations of radical Islamist minorities who reject cultural assimilation into Western social or legal frameworks, a
crisis paralleled in the United States, with important differences, by widespread illegal immigration. An assessment of the ideology of multiculturalism and its
intended and unintended consequences in the fight against terror. The course also examines the threat of terrorists' use of biological, chemical, and nuclear weap-
ons of mass destruction and the defenses against such threats. Finally, it appraises the structure and content of mass media coverage of terrorism, as well as official
and nonofficial propaganda on all sides of these issues. Experts in different fields will give guest lectures throughout the course.

SOC 206 Religion and the Social Order (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Beginning with a review of classical sociological analyses of religion's role in the social order--from Durkheim's study of primitive religions to Weber's assess-
ment of Protestantism and the rise of capitalism--this course considers the changing influence of religion on a wide range of social behaviors and institutional
arrangements. The course will examine, for example, how religious pluralism heightens cultural tension as multiple and conflicting claims are asserted to have
primacy over other claims, resulting in public conflicts over a range of social issues. A prominent and much debated assessment of these conflicts is the so-called
47
"culture wars" thesis. Proponents of the thesis discern deep fissures in the American cultural and religious landscape while critics contend that the divide is not
nearly so polarized. Still others observe relative harmony, arguing that America remains "one nation after all." In addition to exploring the various positions on
this debate, the course will examine the interplay between culture and other contemporary developments in America religious life such as the burgeoning "seeker
church" movement and New Age channeling practices. The class focuses on the United States but lays a conceptual foundation for the cross-cultural study of
religion and the social order.
Expected enrollment: 15.

SOC 214T Exploring the American Culture Wars (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
In the early 1990s, the term "culture wars" entered the lexicon of American political discourse at the same time that social scientists began using the concept to
explain cultural division in contemporary American society. Proponents of the culture wars thesis discern deep and historically unprecedented fissures in the
American cultural and religious landscape. Critics of the thesis, however, argue that the divide is not nearly so polarized, that there is instead relative harmony in
American culture, and that America remains "one nation after all." In examining the debate over the culture wars thesis, the course will engage a variety of
questions: Is the notion of warfare a proper metaphor to depict cultural conflict in contemporary American society? In what ways is the division between so-called
"red states" and "blue states" an electoral expression of the American culture wars? What are the historical roots of contemporary cultural conflict? What, if any,
are the international implications of the American culture wars? In considering these questions, the course will situate the culture wars thesis within the sociologi-
cal literature on religion and society and will examine a variety of cultural skirmishes in contemporary American society, including disputes within such "fields of
conflict" as the family, education, law, electoral politics, and the contested role of religion in public life.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet in pairs with the instructor each week for one hour. One student will write and present a 5- to 6-page analytical

SOC 218(S) Law and Modern Society
This class is designed to introduce students to the field of law and society. The course begins with an overview of the various theoretical perspectives on the
subject, including Durkheimian, Marxist, Foucauldian, and Weberian analyses of law and society; as well as the work of those following in the different theoreti-
cal schools established by these scholars. Informed by the theoretical overview, the next part of the course considers empirical research in selected areas of law,
including tort law, criminal trial procedures, abortion and divorce law, "community justice," and the adjudication of drug offenses. Recognizing that understand-
ings of our own legal practices are enlightened through comparisons to other legal systems, the second half of the course is primarily historical/comparative in
focus. In this section, through an exploration of several case studies, American legal processes and habits are compared with related legal practices in such places
as England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Norway, and Canada.

"This is obvious!" is what we say when we feel that our point is irrefutable. But images are far less obvious than we may like to think. This course will create a
forum for discussing the role of images in our lives, as well as the role played by visual representations in sociological inquiry. It will explore the variety of ways in
which images can be used as diagnostics of society, develop skills for critical analysis of existing representations, and address the limitations, as well as specific
strengths that come with the study of signs and images. Topics for discussion include truth in photography, the problem of interpretation, different visual lan-
guages, the contributions of photography, cinema, TV and digital technologies to changes in social relations, power in visual imagery, the appropriation and
redefinition of visual symbols in different contexts, the "visualization" of ethnic and national stereotypes, and the dilemmas of representation. Primary sources for
the discussions will be drawn from a variety of spheres, from Soviet propaganda posters to Nike commercials, and will include the images we encounter in
everyday life, media, politics, academia, `high' art and pop culture.

SOC 230 Craft and Consciousness (Not offered 2009-2010)
A sociological examination of how craft shapes consciousness. How and in what ways do work experiences shape habits of mind, sensibilities, moral rules-in-
use, ways of seeing and knowing, images of our society, and world views? How do men and women in different occupations and professions establish criteria of
validity and reliability to assess their work experiences? How do they develop and internalize rules for discernment that enable them to sort through multiple and
always conflicting versions and representations of social reality? How do they make moral judgments on complex business, political, and social issues? How and
with what results do common work experiences shape close-knit occupational communities in a modern society? The course will pay particular attention to the
functionally interconnected but experientially disparate occupational worlds of great metropolises. The course will host men and women from a wide range of
occupations and professions--from police detectives to policy analysts, journalists, filmmakers, artists, educators, attorneys, corporate executives, and scien-
tists--to discuss their work and work worlds. Among the readings are: Everett C. Hughes, The Sociological Eye: Work, Self, and Society; Joseph Bensman,

From nineteenth-century opium dens to early-twentieth-century speakeasies to late-twentieth-century crack houses, this course investigates the important impact
of drugs on American society. Focusing on the social control of drug and alcohol use, particularly legal forms of social control, the course analyzes such historical
developments as the rise and fall of prohibition; the early-twentieth-century illegalization of narcotics; the emergence of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics
Anonymous (NA) and other self-help groups; and the recent advent of drug courts and juvenile boot camps. The analysis will include evaluation not only of the
social influence of drugs typically classified as "illicit," such as cocaine, opium, morphine, heroine, and marijuana, but also of alcohol, tobacco, and the recent
emergence and popularity of psycho-pharmaceutical drugs like prozac and ritalin. Rooted in a sociological perspective, the course reviews different theoretical
explanations of drug and alcohol consumption and of the different strategies, legal and otherwise, that have been employed to define and regulate drug use in
American society.

and examine how "the production of space" has been connected to the following themes: knowledge, power, and states; technology and the city; urban survival
and resistance; architecture and urban design; capitalist production and the city; gender and space; maps, nationalism, and cartographic representations; and
"globalizing" cities-cosmopolitanism. Course participants will also view and critique representations of the city appearing in film.

With British India representing one of the grandest projects of European colonization, this course will begin exploring such a complex undertaking by examining
accounts of architectural innovation, the politics of antiquities, town and urban planning, the urban spaces of commodity production, map-making and cartogra-
phy, controversies on `filth' and public hygiene, the emergence of religious processions, and representations of the city in advertising, in twentieth century South
Asia. We will study and debate these accounts to understand how spaces for the exercise of imperial forms of power emerged-and continue to do so. Because
colonialism hoped to spread its reach to other parts of the British empire from its seat of power in India, this course will also engage with debates on world
exhibitions and spectacles of `tradition' in Egypt, Indian Ocean communities, the metropolis of vice and scandal, and linkages with contemporary cosmopolitan-
isms.

SOC 270(S) Cities and Citizenship
What kinds of individuals can live in modern cities? How are modern cities spatially organized and does this affect the social practices that citizens 'ought' to
observe when inhabiting urban centers? Modern cities are distinct in terms of their common experience with state-led urban planning which strives to bring social
and physical order to street life. Participants in this course will explore if and how such institutional desires to control urban space shape the cultural identity of
urban citizens. We will also study how notions of citizenship that diverge from classical European and North American views of political identity, have emerged
as a result of colonization and decolonization, nationalism and transnationalism, economic liberalization, and globalization in the non-western world (ex. urban
planning in South Asia; housing in Mumbai; hyper commercialization in South Africa, and squatter movements in Brasilia). Of course the production of mean-
ings of cities and citizens does not rest solely within the ambit of powerful institutions, elites, and national movements. Therefore we will also examine how art
and aesthetics, public ceremonials, social movements, and street commerce create `insurgent' conceptions of citizenship and urban space.

gives meaning to objects and makes them desirable? Are there non-consumer societies in the modern world? How has globalization changed the ways people
consume in different parts of the globe? This course will explore the consumption and consumer practices as products of modernity and will analyze the political,
cultural and social agendas that have transformed consumption over time. Politics of consumption (the way in which seemingly free and independent consump-
tion choices aggregate into the existing system of global capitalism) will be treated alongside its symbolic element: the role of consumer practices in creating and
articulating identities, building relationships and creating solidarities. It will look at money, fashion, advertising, arts, tourism, and shopping in places as varied as
nineteenth-century France, socialist Russia, postsocialist Hungary and in contemporary United States, tracing both the mechanisms that structure patterns of
consumption, and the implications that these patterns have for the larger social order.

SOC 316 Consumer Society and Its Critics in the Modern World (Not offered 2009-2010)
In the age of Byron, to speak of consumption meant to refer to the tubercular disease. Today, the term "consumer society" hardly requires explanation... or does it?
This course will approach the notion of consumption and consumerism from a critical sociological and historical vantage point. What do we mean, exactly, by
"consumer society," and are there non-consumer societies in the modern world? Why have both consumption and the critiques of consumerism become so
prominent in the 19th and 20th century, and how are they evolving today? What are the philosophical and religious traditions that underlie the various takes on
consumption? What interests, investments, and ideologies are at stake in the debates about the "proper" way to consume? The course will draw on texts from
sociology, anthropology, history and geography, as well as on the analysis of mass media and film, in order to discern the consistent themes and approaches to
framing consumption, and to place them in wider debates about the nature of modernity. We will explore money, fashion, advertising, tourism, shopping and
culture-jamming in places as varied as nineteenth-century France , postsocialist Hungary and contemporary America , critically examining how various groups
grapple with consumer abundance and its effects on society. In doing so, we will pay equal attention to the politics of consumption (the way in which seemingly
free and independent consumption choices play a role in the system of global capitalism) and to its symbolic element: the role of consumer practices in creating
and articulating identities, building relationships and creating solidarities.

SOC 317T(S) The Public and the Private (W)
The sharp distinction between the private and the public spheres is often taken as one of the defining features of the Western modernity itself. Furthermore, the
existence and vibrancy of the public sphere is a crucial precondition for participatory democracy, whereas respect for privacy and provisions and guarantees that
ensure personal autonomy remain fundamental for the daily operations of society. This tutorial course will address the public and the private as concepts that are
always in a state of tension, and will explore these tensions from a sociological and historical vantage point. Topics include: democracy and the public sphere,
publicity and its institutions, from the coffee house to the mass media, individual and collective identities, the "religion of individualism" (Goffman) and its rites
and priests, public and private uses of space, the shifting lines of differentiation between the private and the public and the contestations of this distinction, as well
as the impact of new technologies on the relationship between the public and the private. The tutorial will mainly address the Western cultural tradition, although it
will involve intercultural comparisons, drawing on a wide range of literature, from Jurgen Habermas to Svetlana Boym, Nancy Fraser and Joseph Brodsky.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet in pairs with the instructor for one hour each week. They will write a 5- to 7- page paper based on the readings

Our sense of self is inextricably tied to our understanding of our past, both as individuals and as members of society. This sense of origins, however, is far from
natural; it itself has its origins in the debates and politics of the time, and evolves under an array of influences. This course analyzes discourses of collective and
individual identity and the mechanism involved in the formulation of the individual's sense of his or her place in the world. Topics include: nations and national-
ism, representations of individual and collective pasts, collective memory and practices of remembrance, nostalgia and selective forgetting, narratives of child-
hood and a "golden age," the invention of tradition, museums and memorials, biography and memoirs, narratives of progression, and the making of national and

be made into collectively recognized and remembered events. Participants will engage with relevant works in order to question and debate what terrorism and
violence mean and how these concepts are addressed by various disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. Further, this course will investigate how repre-
sentations of terrorism and violence are connected to the themes of: securing political power, collective resistance, community, and international power relations.
Crucially, the course seeks to enable participants to critically reflect upon the publicly available perspectives on terrorism and violence. The course will encourage
the interpretation, discussion, and writing on the following themes: `tradition' and religion; militancy and nationalism; public spaces and resistance; the role of
emotions in violent movements; community, gender and collective recovery; and memory, orchestrating public panic, and war. Our materials combine analytical,
historical, theoretical and literary texts, and films; all of these speak to the themes of this course and its participants will be encouraged to interpret, critique, and
connect the existing arguments made in the course materials.

In response to the apparent rise in individual and collective celebrations of "traditional community" over the past two decades, this course will examine how the
past is mobilized in order to animate collective identities, address contemporary grievances, and produce events in the present. We will consider the emergence of
modern forms of historical consciousness and writing and interrogate the modalities by which they are produced. Participants will read critical works focused on a

With expanding access to and use of the internet, controversial developments in such biotechnical practices as the cloning of mammals, rapid advances in various
forms of telecommunication, and the increasing sophistication of technological weaponry in the military, the triumph of technology remains a defining feature of
modern life. For the most part, modern humans remain unflinchingly confident in the possibilities technology holds for continuing to improve the human condi-
tion. Indisputably, technology has benefited human life in innumerable ways. However, as with other features of modernity, technology has also had significant,
albeit largely unanticipated, social consequences. Working within a sociological paradigm, this course will focus on the less often examined latent functions of
technology in modern society. It will consider, for example, the social effects of technology on community life, on privacy, and on how people learn, think,
understand the world, communicate, and organize themselves. The course will also examine the effects of technology on medicine, business, education, and the
military and will consider such countercultural reactions to technology as the Luddite movement in early-nineteenth-century England and the U.S. agrarian
movements of the twentieth century.

cal, commercial, social, and organizational-will be considered with attention to propaganda that seeks to overthrow social structures as well as maintain them. The
course will proceed through a series of intensive case studies with a particular focus on propagandists themselves, considered as experts with symbols, and on the
institutional milieux in which they work. Among other examples, we will examine the U.S. Committee on Public Information during the First World War; the
Nazi Ministry of Propaganda; the propaganda machinery in contemporary states and non-state actors of both the left and right, with special attention to the Middle
East; conservative and liberal "public interest" groups; propaganda in contemporary social movements and national political campaigns; the workings of corpo-
rate and university personnel offices; and advertising and public relations agencies in the United States. Throughout the course, we will analyze how the language,
ideologies, and visual symbols of particular varieties of propaganda seem to affect mass audiences.
Format: seminar. Requirements: full participation in seminar, class presentations, and a major paper.

Assistant Professors: NAAMAN, VARGAS*. Visiting Assistant Professor: KHATTAB. Teaching Associate: TBA.
The Certificate in Arabic demonstrates that a student has acquired a working foundation in the language. The sequence of eight language and culture courses is
designed to supplement a student's major at Williams by enabling the student to expand his or her knowledge in a related field.
Required Courses
ARAB 101
ARAB 102
ARAB 201
ARAB 202
ARAB 301
ARAB 302
Electives
at least one course in Arabic literature, arts, or culture
at least one course in Arabic history, religion, politics, or economics
Students must earn a cumulative grade average of B or higher in the sequence of eight courses. In addition, they must receive a score of at least 85% on a language
proficiency test administered by the Arabic faculty. The test is administered once a year during the month of April to all students who wish to obtain the Certifi-
cate. Those interested should express their intent to the Arabic faculty by March 1st or earlier.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in Arabic may be exempted from up to three of the required eight courses. Thus, in order to earn a certificate, a
student must take no fewer than five courses (including three language courses) after enrolling at Williams.
ARAB 101(F)-W-102(S) Elementary Arabic
This is a year-long course in which students will learn to read, write and converse in Arabic while becoming familiar with the basic grammar of Modern Standard
Arabic. Students will also be exposed to the Egyptian variety of colloquial Arabic. This is a communicative-oriented course which revolves around the daily
practice of vocabulary, conversation and different grammatical structures in class. You will be expected to speak Modern Standard Arabic in class from an early
stage. Students will also be expected to take advantage of the technological resources available for the study of Arabic on the internet, as well as the technological
aids available as part of our textbooks for this course, Alif Baa and Al-Kitaab fii Ta'allum al-'Arabiyya from Georgetown University Press.
Format: lectures, five hours a week. Evaluation is based on tests, daily homework, and active class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit 25 (expected: 15).
Students registered for Arabic 101 and 102 are required to attend and pass the sustaining program during the winter study period.
Credit is granted only if both semesters of this course are taken.
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MTWRF First Semester: NAAMAN
9:00-9:50 MTWRF Second Semester: KHATTAB
ARAB 201(F) Intermediate Arabic I
In this course we will continue to study the essential grammar of Modern Standard Arabic while working to improve the linguistic skills obtained in Elementary
Arabic. Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to hold conversations in Arabic with some fluency on a variety of topics while develop-
ing an increased vocabulary and cultural appreciation of Arabic-speaking countries.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on daily performance, homework, quizzes, a midterm and a final exam.
Prerequisites: ARAB 101-102 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 10).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF KHATTAB
ARAB 202(S) Intermediate Arabic II
As a continuation of ARAB 103, this course will expose students to more of the essential grammar of Modern Standard Arabic while increasing their cultural
literacy in Arab civilization. Our main textbook will be Al-Kitaab fii Ta'allum al-'Arabiyya Part II but outside materials from diverse media such as television and
newspapers will also be included. Class will be conducted in Arabic.
Format: lecture. Evaluation is based on quizzes, tests, homework and active class participation.
Prerequisites: ARAB 103 or permission from instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 10).

ARAB 216 Protest Literature: Arab Writing Across Three Continents (Same as Comparative Literature 216) (Not offered 2009-2010)
This course will begin with an analysis of the idea of protest literature as it emerged in an American cultural context in the early twentieth century through the civil
rights movement of the 1960s. We will then seek to revisit the meaning of this term today, particularly as it resonates in the cultural production of Arabs and Arab
youth across three very different locations: the Middle East (specifically Egypt and Palestine), France, and the United States. How are these Arab youth subcul-
tures constituted? In what ways has the globalization of hip-hop influenced the literary, musical, and cinematic production of Arab artists? In what way do rap and
the spoken word in these specific social contexts provide a vocabulary for expressing the violence, lack, and frustration pervasive in these 4th World locations? In
short, how has the contemporary American construction of "blackness" been exported and appropriated by young Arabs today? From Paris to Cairo, from the
West Bank to Detroit, we will examine the varied strands of this new movement for social justice, observing how different forms of literature and music have been
used as a vehicle for resisting war-torn circumstances, poverty, racism and social disenfranchisement across diverse national spaces. Texts for this course will
include novels and poems, as well as a number of films and selections of music. All of these works will be available in translation, although advanced students
may read the originals in French and/or Arabic. Possible novels include those of Charef, Sebbar, Smail, Begag, Chraibi, Ayaidi, Golayyel, Latif, Kanafani, Dar-
wish, Youssef, Hammad, and Kahf.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation, two shorter papers, a presentation, and final paper or project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15-20). Preference given to Comparative Literature and Literary Studies majors.
NAAMAN
ARAB 228(F) Modern Arabic Literature in Translation (Same as Comparative Literature 228) (W) (D)
This course will examine the major themes in contemporary Arabic literature by considering works by writers from across the region. The intent of this course is
to introduce students to the diverse perspectives offered by Arab writers through various literary forms including novels, short stories, poems, films, and inter-
views. Primary attention will be given to the ways in which Arabic literature helps us understand the problematic notion of Arab identity and the idea of a national
self. In addition, works will treat issues such as: the impact of colonialism, the emergence of national consciousness and independence movements, debates
around tradition and modernity, sexuality, representations of women, issues of rural versus urban identity and migration, the traumas of war, Islamification, the
question of religious pluralism, and the role of language in these texts. Possible works will be chosen from Arab countries across North Africa, Saudi Arabia, and
the region of the Levant. Authors may include but are not limited to: Salih, Mahfouz, Munif, Barakat, Daif, Bakr, Zayyat, Tuqan, Takarli, Darwish, Youssef, Kuni,
Yacine, and Djebar. All readings will be in English, though students of Arabic are welcome to read all or portions of the texts in the original. This course fulfills
the EDI requirement as it encourages students to actively identify with the social and cultural contexts unique to Arab peoples. In addition, as postcolonial works
of fiction, many of these novels fundamentally explore questions of power and hegemony. Students will come to understand how the colonial experience chal-
lenged notions of cultural, linguistic, and national belonging and, as a result, generated powerful practices of resistance.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, intermittent reading responses, two short papers and one longer paper; 20-25 pages of
writing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12).
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR NAAMAN
ARAB 233 Introduction to Classical Arabic Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 233) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
In this course we will examine the rich, complex and diverse texts of Classical Arabic Literature. The readings include works that have achieved notoriety outside
of the Arab world (such as the Quran and One Thousand and One Nights) as well as works by authors largely unknown outside of the Arab world but canonical in
Arabic-language culture such as Imru al-Qays, al-Jahiz, al-Ma'arri, Abu Nuwas, al-Hallaj, al-Ghazali and al-Mutannabi. Women's literature in this course in-
cludes works by al-Khansa', known for her elegies, and by Wallada bint al-Mustakfi of Cordoba, who contributed to the courtly love poetry of both Europe and
51
the Arab world. Topics for discussion include theological and philosophical queries, erotica, wine, bibliomania and avarice. Our primary texts represent such
varied regions as the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, Abbasid Baghdad, North Africa and Islamic Spain. Chronologically, the texts range from the sixth century CE to
the fourteenth century. All readings are in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: consistent and pro-active class participation, two 3- to 5-page papers, a final 8- to 10-page paper, one short presentation
and weekly 1- to 2-page reaction papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to Comp Lit or Lit Studies majors and students with a background in Middle Eastern
Studies.
VARGAS
ARAB 262 Outlaws and Underworlds: Arabic Literature of the Margins (Same as Comparative Literature 262) (Not offered 2009-2010)
(W)
The idea of the rogue or the outlaw is a theme that may be traced in Arabic literature from the classical poetry of the pre-Islamic period through to the present. In
considering a range of works from the 6th century onward, this course will explore the way in which the outlaw has historically been used as a literary motif in
Arabic literature to reflect and critique, not just society, but the official literary establishment as well. How does a writer's language--the decision to write in the
vernacular, for example--serve as a way of flouting the cultural establishment in an effort to speak to a more popular audience? In examining characters who live
by thievery or begging--who embrace the ethos of outsiderness--we will return repeatedly to consider the concept of freedom as a driving question in these
works. Between conformity and deviance, decadence and lack, how do we define what makes a person truly free? The rich underworlds that these outlaws inhabit
are sketched for readers as counter-cultures whose alternative way of life and set of values continually challenges the conventions and mores of the mainstream.
Readings will include selections from early Arabic (Suluk) poems, Abu Nuwas' wine poetry, the maqamat tradition of rhymed prose, as well as a number of
contemporary Arabic novels.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation, multiple reading responses, two short papers (5-7 pages) including revisions, and one longer paper (8-10
pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-years and sophomores.
NAAMAN
ARAB 301(F), 302(S) Advanced Arabic
This course is a continuation of Intermediate Arabic. It focuses on expanding the students' knowledge of vocabulary and grammar while stressing the develop-
ment of reading, spoken, and written skills in Modern Standard Arabic. The material covered in class will include lessons from the Al-Kitaab series, as well as
literary and multi-media works. Emphasis will be placed on increasing cultural literacy. Class is conducted in Arabic.
Format: The class meets four hours a week with the fourth hour a conversation section, time to be arranged. Requirements: active class participation, completion
of all written assignments, quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam. Prerequisites for 301: Two semesters of Intermediate Arabic or permission of the instructor.
Prerequisites for 302: Arabic 301 or permission of the instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 8).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF KHATTAB
ARAB 305 Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (Not offered 2009-2010)
This course will serve as an introduction to Egyptian colloquial Arabic. The Egyptian dialect is one of the most widely spoken and understood dialects across the
Arab world; thus, students with little or no exposure to one of the Arabic vernaculars will find this a useful place to begin. The language will be taught by giving
students a systematic understanding of the grammar and the syntax of the colloquial dialect through written materials. With this foundation, students will work to
build and expand their lexicon through active participation in task-based conversations, listening comprehension activities as well as oral presentations. Excerpts
from Egyptian television, radio, film, music and theater will serve to further deepen the students' understanding of Egyptian culture. By employing real-life
situations and drawing from contemporary sources, students will develop a strong foundation in conversational Egyptian Arabic.
Prerequisites: ARAB 202 or equivalent. Requirements: active participation in class, written and oral quizzes, presentations, midterm and final.
Format: language lecture/seminar. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10).
KHATTAB
ARAB 353(S) Writing the City: Beirut and Cairo in Contemporary Arabic Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 353)
The Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury has written that understanding contemporary Lebanese literature requires us to understand "how literature both creates myth
and then seeks to destroy it." This class will consider this statement in relation to the development of the Arabic novel emerging out of Beirut and Cairo in the
latter part of the twentieth century. We will consider the ways in which Lebanese and Egyptian novelists use the motif of the city as a way to take up the prevailing
social and political issues of the day. In so doing we will discuss how some works actively mythologize and celebrate the city as an extension of national identity,
while others portray it as the root cause of the country's social ills. We will also consider how the history of each of these cities was intertwined with the rise and
fall of certain ideological movements in the Arab world whereby the novel, as a relatively new form in the region, served as an alternative medium for theorizing
and considering the efficacy of such movements. In taking up these questions, we will discuss the extent to which the trajectory of the Arabic novel may be
understood as a reflection of the changes affecting these urban milieus and reciprocally the way these two cities are, and continue to be, produced by these fictions.
Throughout the semester we will read a range of works by Lebanese and Egyptian novelists as well as a selection of critical material that theorizes the city in
relation to literature.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation, presentation, two short papers (5-6 pages), and one longer paper (8-10 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15-20). Preference given to Comparative Literature majors and seniors.

ARAB 397(F), 398(S) Independent Study
ARAB 402(F) Advanced Arabic: Media and Translation
This advanced course is designed for students who have successfully completed five semesters of Modern Standard Arabic. Students will continue to develop the
skills needed to comprehend and produce the language of the media in Arabic. Students will be exposed to a wide variety of prepared and authentic material from
the Arabic Press, TV and radio broadcasting, film and the Internet. Emphasis will be placed on enhancing the students' linguistic proficiency by building their
vocabulary and familiarity with commonly used idiomatic expressions. The aim of this course is to help students produce the language at a more sophisticated
level. In addition, part of the course will focus on students developing the ability to successfully translate material from Arabic into English and vice versa. Not
only will we focus on some of the challenges that translation--both into and from--Arabic presents, but students will be offered some basic strategies for suc-
cessfully working between the two languages.
Prerequisites: ARAB 302 or permission of instructor. Requirements: active participation in class, presentations, short essays and/or translation projects (weekly),
one midterm writing project and one final writing project.

MAJOR
Three routes are offered: the emphasis of the first is on the history of art, and that of the second is on creative work in studio. The third route through the major
allows students to take courses in both halves of the department in more or less equal numbers.
Note: The Art History and Art Studio routes are strongly recommended for any prospective Art major who is contemplating graduate study in Art History or
Art Studio.
Art History Route
Sequence courses
ArtH 101-102 Aspects of Western Art
One of the following courses in Studio Art to be taken by the end of the junior year: ArtS 100, 101, 102, 109
ArtH 301 Methods of Art History
One 400-level Seminar or Graduate Course
Parallel courses
Any five additional semester courses of art history including three concerned with the following:
1) a period of art prior to 1800
2) a period of art prior to 1400
3) non-Western art
Although the structure of the art history route allows for flexible scheduling, the faculty strongly recommends that students proceed through the major in the
recommended sequence. Introductory 100- and 200-level courses should be taken in the first or second year. So that they are prepared for the research require-
ments of the seminar classes that cap the sequence, majors are required to take the required Junior major class, ArtH 301 during their junior year. If the student is
studying abroad for the entire junior year, this requirement may be filled in the senior year (see STUDY ABROAD policy of the Art Department for more informa-
tion.)

One ArtH seminar (400-level) or one 500-level graduate course except 508
One 300-level ArtS course or (with permission) ArtS 418T Senior Tutorial
Parallel courses
Any four additional Art Studio or Art History courses. At least one elective must be taken in each wing of the department. At least one of the electives
must be an Art History course concerned with a period of Western or non-Western art prior to 1800.
Art History Route: The history of art is different from other historical disciplines in that it is founded on direct visual confrontation with objects that are
both concretely present and yet documents of the past. We emphasize analysis of images, objects, and built environments as the basis for critical
thought and visual literacy. In addition to formal and iconographic analysis, we use the work of other disciplines to understand visual images, such as
social history, perceptual psychology, engineering, psychoanalysis, cultural studies, and archaeology. Because of its concentration on visual experi-
ence, the Art History major increases one's ability to observe and to use those observations as analytical tools for understanding history and culture.
ArtH 101-102 introduces students to a series of critical studies of important works selected from the history of Western art from antiquity to the present. The
critical approach of the introductory course is maintained in all further courses, especially by assigned study of original works in the Williams College Museum of
Art, Chapin Library, the Clark Art Institute, and Mass MoCA.
An introductory studio course, ArtS 100, in which no artistic talent or prior experience are assumed, provides vital training in what is a visual as well as a verbal
discipline. The requirement of a course in non-Western art expands majors' geographic as well as cultural horizons, and the requirement of two courses in art from
periods prior to 1800 provides a necessary concentration on earlier moments in culture. (As the late contemporary architect, Philip Johnson, said, "You cannot not
know history.") The junior course (ArtH 301) develops awareness of the theoretical implications, as well as the possibilities and limitations of different art-histori-
cal methods. The requirement of a seminar or graduate course in the senior year enables students to apply that knowledge of methodology to their most special-
ized work in the Art History route.
Art Studio Route: The studio division of the Art major has been structured to foster the development of a critical understanding of making art; to support creative
interests and to develop students' perceptions and imaginations as they investigate a variety of visual media. Drawing I, ArtS 100 serves as an introduction to
the basic drawing and design principles which establish the foundation for the development of visual expression. ArtH 101-102, Aspects of Western Art, pro-
vides part of the necessary background in the critical analysis of art. The 200-level ArtS courses provide opportunities to learn the elements of some of the
principal visual arts media: architecture, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, and video. These courses combine technical foundations in the medium
with analysis of the interrelation of visual form and content. The 300- and 400-level courses place a greater emphasis on the application of appropriate visual skills
and strategies to particular thematic concerns, and to the development of the student's individual vision. All students taking ArtS418 are required to exhibit in the
spring of their senior year at the Williams College Museum of Art or other appropriate venues. Students who choose to take two 300-level classes do not exhibit at
WCMA in the spring of the senior year.
History and Practice Route: This route allows students to study in depth both the history of art and the making of it. It offers considerable flexibility: students may
propose courses of study that emphasize particular media, themes or methodological issues. To mention just three examples, students may design sequences of
courses that focus on architecture, gender or narration in both the history of art and contemporary practice. Students may take more courses in one wing of the
department than the other, as long as the minimum requirements in each wing are satisfied. The History and Practice route is especially well-suited to students
interested in arts-related careers outside of higher education, including work in art galleries, art museums, and primary or secondary school education.
53
Unlike the history or studio routes, acceptance into the History and Practice route is not automatic. The student must first submit a written application in two
copies, one for each advisor from the two wings of the department, as well as a list of proposed courses; this application and list of proposed courses must be given
to the department secretary before registering for the major.
The application must provide a narrative statement of the theme of the major, and why it cannot be accommodated in either history or studio. It is not enough to
submit a list of courses; the student needs to show the coherence and integrity of the plan of study, and how it develops the theme of the proposed major.
Some students will be attracted to both wings of the department but will not have a field of study that falls between the two. In these cases, it is better for the
student to choose between history and studio--taking additional courses from the other wing as desired. In short, the History and Practice route is reserved for
students with a strong record of achievement who cannot be accommodated in the two wings of the department.
History and Practice majors do not participate in the senior studio exhibition at the end of the year.
History and Practice Faculty Advisors: Michael Glier, Ann McCallum, and Ben Benedict in studio; E. J. Johnson, Peter Low and Michael Lewis in history.
COURSE NUMBERS
First Digit
The 100-level courses in both Art History and Studio are introductions to the field and emphasize visual and critical analysis. These courses do not require
previous experience in the subject and they are often prerequisites for other courses in the department; 200-level courses are introductions to specific fields;
300-level courses prepare students for independent research; 400-level courses emphasize independent research, oral presentation, and active participation
and are intended for advanced students, usually senior majors.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ART
Students who wish to become candidates for the degree with honors must show prior evidence of superior performance in the major as well as research
capabilities to carry out the proposed project.
Art History
To graduate with honors in art history, students are to enroll in the Senior Honors Seminar during the Spring semester of their senior year, where they will
develop an original research paper based on prior research. To be admitted to the seminar, students must have completed ArtH 301 in their Junior year. To enter
the class, students must either be nominated by a faculty member, or apply independently to the Department Honors Committee for admission. Students who
have been nominated, as well as students who wish to apply for admission to the Honors Seminar, must submit an original research paper that was completed in a
prior art history class. The paper must be properly formatted and include illustrations, a bibliography, and an abstract of not more than 250 words. These docu-
ments are to be turned in to the Department Secretary no later than the end of the exam period of the Fall semester. The department Honors Committee will invite
students (no more than 10) to enroll in the Honors Seminar based on the quality of the original research, the student's GPA within the major, and the willingness
and availability of appropriate faculty advisors. Notification of admission to the seminar will be sent to students by early January. Since enrollment is by invitation
only, students should pre-register for four classes and, if invited, drop one of them and add the Honors Seminar during drop-add period. The Honors Seminar is to
be taken in addition to the required courses for the major. Once in the seminar, students will revise, refine and expand on previous research and produce a paper of
approximately 25 pages and present a shortened version of the paper to the faculty and public at the Williams College Museum of Art.
Art Studio:
Studio art concentrators who wish to be candidates for honors are required to add a 200-level course, and to take the 400-level senior tutorial. An additional
300-level tutorial or 200-level course must be added for a total of twelve courses.
Honors candidates enrolled in the senior tutorial must "evidence" prior experience in the media chosen for the honors work. This "evidence" may consist of
one or more 200-level courses in the medium, course work at the 300 level and/or a slide portfolio demonstrating the student's proficiency in the media chosen for
the honors project. This work is presented to the senior tutorial instructor at the start of the spring semester.
At the end of the spring semester of the senior year, the honors candidate will orally defend his/her work in the senior exhibition at WCMA. The entire studio
faculty will attend the defense. Based on the work and the oral defense, the studio faculty (as a whole) will designate honors, high honors or no honors.
History and Practice:
The route to honors is a combination of the Art Studio and Art History honors routes. At the beginning of senior year, a candidate for honors in History and
Practice makes a proposal to two faculty members, one faculty advisor from each wing of the department. If both advisors agree to supervise the project, the
candidate enrolls in independent study and works through the fall semester and winter study. The progress of the project is assessed by both advisors at the end of
winter study; if the project is not well enough developed, the advisors may end it at that time. If the project is allowed to move forward, the student enrolls either in
ArtS 418T Senior Tutorial, if the project is primarily a matter of making art, or in an Honors Independent Study, if it is primarily a writing project. The final project
is submitted to the two advisors, who will determine whether or not it will receive honors.
STUDY ABROAD
Although the Art Department encourages students to travel and study abroad, we feel that it is very important for students to begin their major with a required
seminar in their Junior year. The Junior seminars, ArtH 301 and ArtS 319, prepare students for independent research and/or independent artistic production which
is the focus of the senior year.
a. Studio Art Majors must take the required Junior Seminar (ArtS 319) in their junior year unless they are planning to study abroad for a full year; in that
case they may take the required class in their senior year.
b. History and Practice students must include their Study Abroad plans in their application to the major and discuss them with their advisor.
c. Art History students must take one of the required Junior Seminar (ArtH 301) in their junior year unless they are planning to study abroad for a full year;
in that case they may take the required class in their senior year.
ART HISTORY COURSES
ARTH 101(F)-102(S) Aspects of Western Art
A year-long introduction to a history of some European and North American art, this course concentrates on three-dimensional media in the fall (architecture and
sculpture) and two-dimensional media in the spring (painting, drawing, prints and photography). Even though the course focuses on Western art, it also explores
interchanges among other cultures and the west, particularly in more recent times.
Both semesters cover the same chronological span, from Ancient Greeks to computer geeks. We organize the course in this unusual way not only to give students
the grasp of history but also to heighten their ability to understand visual objects by coming to grips with only one artistic medium at a time. To train students to
look carefully at art, we use the wealth of art resources in Williamstown: the Clark Art Institute, the Williams College Museum of Art and the Chapin Rare Book
Library. Students spend time with, and sometimes even hold, original works of art. For the study of architecture we have a unique set of "Virtual Buildings," made
expressly for this course, that approximate the experience of being in structures thousands of miles away.
Format: lecture. Requirements: quizzes, midterm, two papers and a final exam.
ArtH 101-102 may not be taken on a pass/fail basis; however, the course may be audited. Students who have audited ArtH 101-102 lectures on a registered basis
may enroll in any Art History course at the 200 or 300 level. Both semesters of the course must be taken on a graded basis to receive credit for either semester.
No enrollment limit. Open to first-year students.

ARTH 103(S) Asian Art Survey: From the Land of the Buddha to the World of the Geisha
This course introduces to students some of the major monuments of Asian art with an emphasis on the art of India, China, and Japan. Its contextual approach helps
students gain insight into the aesthetic, religious, and political ideas and cultural meanings conveyed by the works of art. Visual analyses and thematic discussions
will bear upon the interconnectedness among these three cultures, and their respective interactions with the West. This course also provides students with the
vocabulary, techniques, and patterns of thinking needed for advanced art history courses.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on three 30- to 40-minute quizzes, two short papers, film screening and class attendance.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25. Highly recommended for first-year students.

ARTH 105 Picturing God in the Middle Ages: An Introduction (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
How did Christians come to depict God? How did they visualize the deity described in the Bible as well as such theological subtleties as the Incarnation and the
Trinity? And what purposes did pictures of God serve, both in public and private life? Paying particular attention to the function of works of art, this freshman
seminar will examine the evolution of medieval Christian images of God, in both the Eastern and Western halves of Europe, and the problems these images often
generated. Among other specific topics, the course will investigate: the impact of the Roman cult of the emperor and of images of the dead on the earliest portraits
of Christ; theological debates about the nature of spiritual versus physical vision and their influence on the making and viewing of images; the relationship of
sacred images to relics, the Eucharist, and other aspects of Christian ritual; and the pictorial exploration of both the torture and sexuality of Christ.

ARTH 110 Reading the Renaissance: Interpreting Italian Renaissance Art and History (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
Many works of Renaissance art, such as Botticelli's Birth of Venus, Leonardo's Mona Lisa, and Michelangelo's David, are remarkably familiar to us. But even as
they live in our cultural consciousness, we may perceive them as elevated and remote masterpieces of western culture, housed away in museums halfway around
the world. Just what is it that makes these objects so admired and important? And what might we all have to gain, intellectually, by considering them? We will
focus in depth on a series of individual works of art, learning and honing skills of observation, visual and contextual analysis, and written and oral expression. But
we will also step back from the objects to explore and balance different approaches and points of view and to consider, more broadly, different issues that can
factor into the very act of interpretation. The goal of the course is that students emerge from it with a rich understanding of the selected works in question, as well
as a mindfulness of the ways in which the Renaissance period might inform our aesthetic perceptions and our critical understanding of the construction of the past.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on three 5- to 7-page papers (including installments and revisions), two presentations, and engaged peer critiques and
class participation.

ARTH 201(F) American Landscape History (Same as Environmental Studies 201) (W)
A survey course stressing the visual attributes and historical geography of regional, vernacular (that is, ordinary or pervasive) American settings, with the goal of
discerning a national style of spatial or landscape organization. Among the human-altered environments to be studied, from an evolutionary or diachronic per-
spective, are: forestlands, rangelands, croplands, outdoor recreational sites, mines and quarries; power and utilities; small towns, mill towns, central business
districts, and suburbs; housing, industry, commerce, and institutional uses such as the American college campus; water, road, and rail corridors as examples of
circulation nets. Given the course's breadth of topics and, by contrast, other courses (see ArtH 311 and 318 during this academic year) concentrating on specific
land uses, a major objective in this survey will lie in discerning generic stylistic continuities and discontinuities, or changes, which the landscape activities or sites
express.
One outdoor, afternoon meeting each week provides discussion opportunities in situ, and enables class members to obtain a deeper or first-hand familiarity with a
rural-urban gradient of representative land uses and occupants of the Hoosic-Hudson watershed and Taconic upland region surrounding Williamstown, as well as
practicums in interviewing and field study methodologies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: weekly essays advancing the documentation of an individually-chosen landscape site or behavior, simultaneously with
the wider textual and field context which the course itself provides. The first Friday in November there will be an obligatory all-day field session, pondering an
urban-rural gradient from Troy, New York to Salem, New York.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Open to first-year students. Preference to American Studies, Art, and Environmental Studies majors or

ARTH 205 Picturing Race: From Early Modern Europe to Now (Same as Africana Studies 205) (Not offered 2009-2010)
This historically wide-ranging course surveys visual representations of race in three different periods-early modern Europe, the 19th-20th centuries, and the
contemporary-in order to ask questions about how art establishes conventions for racial imagery and about how art may challenge and revise these conventions.
The course begins with the black servant motif in Renaissance portraits of white patrons by, for example, Anthony van Dyck, both to identify standard visual
elements in the repertoire of poses for black attendants and, equally, to note departures from the norm. The second section considers Winslow Homer's Caribbean
paintings (with subsequent transformations in the subject by Romare Bearden and Derek Walcott), as well as works by African-American artists such as Henry O.
Tanner and Jacob Lawrence. The course concludes with discussion of Glenn Ligon, Fred Wilson, Kara Walker, and other contemporary artists who engage in
re-visionary explorations of identity. Throughout, analysis of race includes "whiteness" as a racial category. Time will be spent at the Williams College Museum
of Art viewing works from the collection.
Format: lecture and discussion. Evaluation based on participation in class discussions; midterm; final; short paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to Art majors and Africana Studies concentrators.

ARTH 212(S) Distant Encounters: East Meets West in the Art of the European Middle Ages
This lecture course investigates the rich artistic consequences--in architecture, manuscript illumination, mosaic, sculpture, panel painting, fresco, metalwork, and
other minor arts--of European contact with the Eastern Mediterranean between approximately 300 and 1450 AD. From the beginnings of Christianity, pilgrims
from Europe made the long journey to sacred sites in the Holy Land (extending across parts of present-day Egypt, Israel, Syria, and Turkey). When these sites
became less accessible with the spread of Islam in the seventh century, Europeans sought to recreate the sites at home. Later, from 1095 onward, Christian
Europeans attempted to reclaim and hold the Holy Land from non-Christians by force, through an ill-fated series of five major and several lesser "crusades." Over
the centuries, before, during, and after the Crusades, exposure to the peoples, ideas, and cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean also came through trade and
through the travel and settlement of non-Europeans in Europe itself, particularly in Spain, Sicily, and Venice. The course aims to survey artistic production within
each of these different contexts of East-West encounter.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two to three short papers, midterm, and final exam.
No prerequisite, but previous coursework in medieval art helpful (ArtH 101-102, 223, or 224). Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20).

ARTH 213 Greek Art and Myth (Same as Classics 213) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Classical myth provides rich subject matter for painters and sculptors throughout the history of western art. This course investigates the earliest representation of
myth in Greek art of the seventh through the first centuries B.C.E. Sophisticated narratives involving gods and heroes first appear in a variety forms and contexts.
Myth informs the visual culture of the Greeks on many levels, from paintings on vases used in domestic contexts to the marble sculpture that decorated the
monumental temples of great sanctuaries throughout the Greek world. The purpose of the course is two-fold: to familiarize students with the subjects and narra-
tives of Greek myths and the underlying belief system that, in part, produced them, and also provide a comprehensive outline of developments in Greek art in the
first millenium B.C.E. Of special interest will be the techniques developed by artists for representing narratives visually, as well as the conceptual issues that
underlie certain myths, such as sacrifice, war, marriage, coming of age, specific festivals, and the relationships between men and women, and those between
mortals and immortals. Reading will include ancient literature in translation (Hesiod, Homer, Sappho, Aischylos, Sophokles, Euripides and Apollodorus) as well
as secondary literature by contemporary authors that provides insights into the religious, social and historical developments that influenced artists in their choices
of subject matter and style.
Format: lecture. Requirements: two short papers, quiz, hour test, final exam. Required fieldtrip to The Metropolitan Museum in New York.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 45 (expected: 45). The course satisfies the pre-1400 and pre-1800 requirements.

ARTH 216(S) Body of Evidence: Greek Sculpture and the Human Figure (Same as Classics 216)
From the beginnings of Greek sculpture in the eighth century B.C.E. until the end of the Hellenistic period in the first century B.C.E., the human figure remained
the most prominent choice of subject for Greek artists. Introductory classes will cover sculpture in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages but the goal of this course is to
study Greek sculpture in the first millennium B.C.E. with emphasis on ancient Greek attitudes toward the body. We will consider the function, surroundings and
reception of male and female figures, both human and divine, from athletic, religious and funerary contexts, and look at dedications of individuals figures as well
as the complex mythological narratives found on Greek temples. Reading material includes ancient literature in translation as well as contemporary critical es-
says.

ARTH 217(F) Photography and Modernity in the United States, 1880-1950
This seminar examines both the ascendance of modernism as the prevalent style for artistic photography and the broader role the medium played in the trans-
formation of American society. During the years covered, photographers reflected the complicated cultural responses to rapid industrialization and urbanization,
55
booming economies and the devastating bust that followed, to the desire for a national style, and finally World War and its aftermath. The class will have the
opportunity to carefully examine photographs ranging from hand-crafted prints made at the turn of the century, created to reassert the human touch, to glossy
black and white images from later decades whose makers openly celebrated their mechanical medium. Special attention will be given to photography's dissemi-
nation through reproduction in books, magazines, and newspapers. Threading through the course will be the career of Edward Steichen who will be the subject of
a one-person show at the college museum and whose career spanned most of the period under consideration.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: weekly discussion of assigned readings, two short essays (3 pages each) and one longer research paper (10-12 pages).

ARTH 220(F) The Mosque
The mosque (masjid) is the site of communal prayer rituals as well as many other activities in Islamic cultures. By definition, it must simply be a clean space
oriented towards Mecca. In actuality, mosques have taken diverse architectural forms ranging from simple hypostyle halls of mud-brick to elaborate complexes of
reinforced concrete and plate glass. This course will address the stylistic and regional differences from the seventh to twentieth century, including the columned
halls of the central Arab lands, the centralized domed structures of the Ottoman world and the courtyard structures of the Persian tradition. Elements of architec-
tural decoration such as monumental calligraphy, glazed tilework and carved stucco will also be considered. The course will culminate in a consideration of
modern mosque architecture in which tradition and modernism combine to generate new forms of sacred space.

ARTH 222 Foto Art: Germany 1960 to the Present (Same as ArtH 561) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Since its invention in 1839, photography has periodically challenged artists in traditional media to rethink their practice. Already in the nineteenth century, major
painters such as Edgar Degas used photographs as an aid. There was also a widespread notion that photography could achieve a superior, "objective" knowledge
of the visual world that would render representational painting superfluous and obsolete. What was not foreseen was the potential for unusual forms of interme-
dial cross-fertilization that began to emerge in the 1960s, as, for example, individual artists began working in both painting and photography, sometimes combin-
ing them in single work. Neither did one anticipate the use of photography--and even of painting--to interrogate and critique the photographic medium itself, nor
its deployment in the new genre of installation art. These examples represent a new category of artistic practice, that of "artists who work with photography," as
opposed to practitioners of "straight photography" or even of art photography. These practices have arguably found their richest embodiment in Germany: in the
work of painters such as Anselm Kiefer, Sigmar Polke, and Gerhard Richter, in Joseph Beuys's expanded notion of sculpture, in the serial photography of Bernd
and Hilla Becher and their pupils Candida Hfer, Thomas Ruff, and Thomas Struth, in the installations of Hanne Darboven, and the work of Thomas Demand,
Hans-Peter Feldmann, Andreas Gursky, and Katharina Sieverding among others. Their practices will be examined in both a historical and a contemporary inter-
national context.

ARTH 224 Romanesque and Gothic Art and Architecture: The Medieval Church in Context (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered
2010-2011)
The goal of this course is to survey the major works of ecclesiastical architecture, sculpture and stained glass produced in France between approximately 1050 and
1400. These works were not created in isolation from their surroundings; thus we will attempt to understand them not only stylistically, but also in their original
functional, social, and sometimes even political settings. The course will emphasize the abbey church and the cathedral, the two major ecclesiastical buildings of
this period, as heterogeneous entities that used architecture, sculpture, stained glass and other media, in conjunction with church ritual, to render their sacred
spaces distinct from, and elevated above, the world outside. We will furthermore try to appreciate the special centrality of the abbey church and the cathedral in
high medieval society. Sites for contact with God and for the development of advanced learning, they could also serve as critical determinants of local economic
and political life, and as focuses of pilgrimage, trade, and international cultural exchange.

ARTH 232(F) The Visual Culture of Renaissance Rome
During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the city of Rome saw itself transformed from a shrinking and neglected medieval town into a thriving center of artistic
achievement. This lecture course focuses on the historical, geographic, and ideological forces behind this period of renovation and restoration forces that re-
worked the urban fabric of the city while shaping the character of the visual arts from Filarete and Fra Angelico to Bramante, Michelangelo, and Raphael. We will
examine monuments such as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, then, not only as touchstones for the history of western art, but also as images capable of reflecting,
and even constructing, a uniquely Roman sense of power, time, and historical destiny.

ARTH 305T(S) Art, Life, Death: Studies in the Italian Renaissance (W)
We often think the Italian Renaissance as a transformation of the visual arts--a moment that pulled away from the Middle Ages and set the stage for a new world
of images detached from function and human experience. But art in Renaissance Italy was hardly produced "for art's sake." This sophomore-level tutorial course
will examine, through a series of focused case studies, ways in which the exciting and innovative world of the Renaissance was also a vital one. We will examine
canonical works by Masaccio, Donatello, Botticelli, Michelangelo, Raphael, and others not as mere examples of artistic achievement, but as complex visual
responses to life's big questions. What is love? How do we bridge the world of the living and that of the dead? How can we conceptualize our relationship with
divinity? How is power constructed along the lines of gender and sexuality? What defines us and constructs us as individuals? How will we be judged by our
contemporaries and by posterity? We will consider these questions and more. Along the way we will explore the distance and proximity of the Renaissance past
57
and our own moment, considering ways to articulate or refine the notion of universal resonance of artistic expression. Coursework will include many primary
sources, not least the works of art themselves (students will be expected to look as well as read in preparation for class).
Format: tutorial. Course requirements will include five papers of 5-7 pages, 5 written responses to the work of the tutorial partner, and one final paper (a revised
version of one of the original 5 papers). Evaluation will be based on written work and critical conversation.

ARTH 311(S) North American Suburbs (Same as Environmental Studies 311) (W)
This course, with two morning and one afternoon (field) sessions weekly, details the intentions, built forms, and historical unfolding of that environment which
now houses more Americans than either city or countryside. Among the topics to be studied are: seminal suburban communities in various regions of Canada and
the United States; the quest for a rural ideal and the celebration of a tamed outdoors; the extent to which suburbs may be environments for child-raising, given the
status of youth in modern societies; the successional patterns as farmlands, or estates, are subdivided (as with Dutch New York's bouweries) and later may
become part of central business districts; the kaleidoscope of architectural styles and revivals; the manner in which these communities may be products of their
various linkage systems to a central place, or city; the degree to which they are increasingly centers in their own right, with attendant automobile-induced hori-
zontality; and their unfolding historiography. For that historiography this seminar will scrutinize comparatively the work of such scholars or commentators as
Scott, Copeland, Olmsted, Gottmann, Warner, Gans, Fishman, Kelly, Kennedy, Venturi, Binford, Rowe, Stern, Kenneth Jackson, Sies. Special attention, in the
field, will be given to the suburban growth of Albany.
Format: lecture/discussion during morning sessions; site visits/discussion during afternoon sessions. Requirements: weekly essays, field observations, and occa-
sional note-takings, all for publication; there will likely be an obligatory late spring Sunday-Monday study session to Montreal, under the aegis there of the urban

ARTH 317(S) Topics in Chinese Art (W) (D)
This course is an in-depth thematic study of Chinese art in the context of its contemporary cultural phenomena. Topics of interest include "Picturing Power: From
Ritual Bronze Vessels to the Socialist Posters of the Mao Era; "Chinese Landscape Painting: Meanings and Functions;" "Gender Construction in Chinese Art;"
"Chinese Art in the Age of Exploration and Beyond: Western Influence in Chinese Art;" and "The Bold and Outrageous: Contemporary Chinese Art," among
other things. Investigation of these topics offers students an understanding of the important development in style and subject matter in Chinese art, as well as the
aesthetic, theoretical, and cultural issues that underpinned this development. This course will also draw upon parallel topics that are discussed and debated in other

ARTH 318(S) The American Pastoral Mode (Same as Environmental Studies 318) (W)
An inquiry into a nation's largest land use, (once?) dominated by domesticated cattle and sheep grazing, often on a middle ground between arable (or urban?)
lowlands and upland forests. In the East a land use in decline as animal husbandry is instead practiced intensively in factory farms. The expression of an arguable
pastoralism by artists like Catlin, Cropsey, Butcher, O'Keefe, Adams, Plowden, and Nelson, by writers like Jefferson, Burroughs, T. Roosevelt, Sandoz, Athearn,
and by historians or natural resource thinkers like Powell, Webb, Malin, Weaver, Calef, Limerick, and Carlson--with considerations, inter alia, of aridity, scale,
transhumance, settlement diffusion, recalcitrance in terrain, the era of "open range" as a golden age, the aesthetics of breeds (as revealed in animal portraiture and
breeding association standards of conformance), the rise of the disciplines of range and wildlife management, or applied science. Objects to be scrutinized, both
visually and evolutionally, will include the cowboy, the ranchstead, corrals, barbed wire and fencing laws, gates, trails, windmills and other rangeland water
developments (including their attendant "sacrifice areas"), government allotments, corrals, the impress of livestock trails and selected plant and animal species,
both wild and domesticated, both wanted and unwanted. Some consideration of pastoral attributes in contemporary culture, as in suburban site design, Hollywood
westerns, informal, one-storey dwellings, the ownership of pets, fashion or costumery.
Format: morning lecture and discussion sessions, afternoon field or screening sessions. Requirements: weekly 4-page essays on ten assigned topics, and two
unassigned, all to be published as class documents; occasional note-takings. Four papers, totaling approximately 20-25 pages of writing.

ARTH 330T(F) Michelangelo: Biography, Mythology, and the History of Art (W)
One might argue that Michelangelo's enduring fame, and his preeminence in the western art historical canon, is as much a product of his artistic persona as his
artistic achievement. Indeed, the modern notion of the visual artist as a brooding, even tortured genius of unstoppable creative force finds its roots in the Italian
Renaissance. This is largely due to the singular figure of Michelangelo, whose life and career are more fully documented than those of any western artist to
precede him. And Michelangelo's mythic individuality, alongside his artistic innovations and contributions, have made him a fundamental force in the shape of
the history of art as we understand and study it today. Students of this tutorial will become well-acquainted with the life and work of Michelangelo through the
examination of a wide variety of primary and secondary sources: contemporary Renaissance documents, letters, poetry, and biographies; art historical surveys,
monographs, and studies; and documentary and popular film. They will give their critical attention, however, to the intersection between this artist's biography
and his artistic production. We will focus on a number of important questions arising from this connection. What, for example, is the nature and reliability of the
evidence used to reconstruct Michelangelo's life and personality? What are the grounds for interpreting his work according to his philosophical outlook, religious
beliefs, and even sexuality? To what extent was Michelangelo responsible for shaping his own persona for posterity? Is the myth of this artist distinguishable from
his "reality?" And to what extent have all these issues shaped our own thinking about artists and the history of art?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: evaluation will be based on the quality and improvement of written work (5 weekly papers and 5 response papers, and a final
written exercise addressing major themes of the tutorial), and oral dialogue.
Prerequisite: one Art History course of any level. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors.

ARTH 402 Monuments and The Art of Memorial (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
The urge to commemorate individuals, heroic acts or historic events whether unspeakable or splendid is both human and timeless. This seminar will document
and explore the concepts behind and the nature of monuments, both commemorative ones, and those that admonish or inform without commemorating a specific
event or individual. Students will study and analyze monuments and memorials from the ancient Mediterranean (Egypt; Mycenae; Greece of the Archaic, Classi-
cal and Hellenistic periods; Imperial Rome) and chart their their influence on monuments in later history, especially those of the nineteenth and twentieth centu-
ries. The current trend towards countermonuments, or anti-monuments, such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial or the Gerzes' vanishing "Monument
Against Fascism, War and Violence and For Peace and Human Rights" in Hamburg/Harburg will be discussed in light of the monumental tradition of combining
word, image, and architecture to create memorials that will endure in both spatial and temporal terms. Ongoing discussions of Holocaust memorials and the
58
problems inherent in the design of the monument for the WTC will also be addressed. Students will be asked to design a commemorative monument for the final
class meeting.

ARTH 405(S) Seminar in Architectural Criticism (W)
How does one judge a building? According to its structural efficiency or its aesthetic qualities? Its social responsibility--or just its pizzazz? Depending on the
building, and the critic, any of these questions might be pertinent, or impertinent. This seminar explores architectural criticism, that curious genre between litera-
ture and architecture, and looks at its history, nature and function. We will read and discuss classic reviews by historical and contemporary critics as John Ruskin,
Mariana van Rensselaer, Lewis Mumford, Ada Louise Huxtable and Herbert Muschamp. Insights gained from these discussions will be applied by students to
writing their own reviews, which will likewise be discussed in class. Early assignments will concentrate on mechanics: how to describe a building vividly and
accurately, how to balance description and interpretation judiciously, how to compare. Subsequent ones will be more synthetic, encouraging students to write
bold, lively and critical essays. The ultimate goal is to develop a distinctive and effective voice, and to gain a better understanding of the nature of criticism in
general.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Students will write and revise six papers (5-7 pages) during the semester.

This course focuses on major developments in contemporary art practice over the last two decades and key methods that have developed to elucidate these
practices. The seminar is designed for both art history and studio art majors. As we explore various critical frameworks used to interpret and analyze contempo-
rary art, both studio and history majors will focus on expanding critical vocabularies and developing analytical skills in a manner that takes into account both
theory and practice. Throughout this process we will also critically examine the changing definitions and roles of artist, critic, curator, and audience. Topics will
include: installation, appropriation and the remix, globalization and hybridity, archival practices, and forms of participation and collaboration that generate new
audiences and/or sites of encounter.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class presentations, two short papers, one research paper, and presentations. Approximately 30 pages of writing.

ARTH 422 Making the Stones Speak: The Emergence and Development Of the Romanesque Sculpted Portal (Not offered 2009-2010; to be
offered 2010-2011)
Beginning around the year 1000, European Christendom experienced a great ecclesiastical building boom. According to a contemporary chronicler, "it was as if
the whole earth, having cast off the old by shaking itself, were clothing itself everywhere in the white robe of the church." During the course of the eleventh
century, the designers of these structures fashioned a new architectural language that we now label "Romanesque." One of the most innovative and dramatic
aspects of this new language was its assimilation of monumental sculpture, absent in Europe since the fifth century. The focus of attention in this regard was the
portal, which marked the threshold between the profane realm of the outside world and the sacred space of the church. This seminar will investigate the anteced-
ents and origins of the Romanesque sculpted portal and examine in detail its greatest manifestations. Emphasis will be placed on understanding these often
complex sculptural schemes within their original functional and physical contexts. What role did this imagery play in structuring the medieval visitor's overall
experience of the church? And what did it mean to have this imagery carved into the very fabric of "God's temple"?
Format: seminar. Requirements: class discussion, class presentation, 15- to 20-page research paper.

ARTH 426(F) Pictures That Rocked the Nation: Courbet and Manet in Second Empire France (Same as Women's and Gender Studies
426) (D)
How do we recognize or see diversity in the works of canonical artists? If modernist painting has often been understood to put pressure on existing power rela-
tions, the stylistic innovation that defines it has just as often been used to veil its controversial subject matter. The aim of this course is two-fold: 1) to call attention
to difference through comparative analysis and to consider how and why identifying it is meaningful; 2) to detail the changes in historiography since the 1970s
that have enabled discussions of difference (sex, class, race, ethnicity, sexuality) and the challenges they present. The course demonstrates that the Second Empire
(1851-1870) in France was an especially fertile period for innovations in style and subject matter that generated both outrage and incomprehension. In the wake of
the revolution of 1848, realism and its rallying cry ("il faut tre de son temps") brought home subjects that heretofore had been safely displaced to the classical or
exotic worlds as they were imagined by the West. The Second Empire coincided with the birth of mass culture so that artists had access to new types of imagery
and increasing contact with racy and controversial subjects.
This course will investigate polemical works by Gustave Courbet (i.e. Burial at Ornans, Origin of the World) and Edouard Manet (i.e. Olympia, The Execution of
Emperor Maximilian) through the lens of critical writings of the 1850s and 1860s (i.e. Baudelaire, Proudhon, Zola) as well as revisionist writings from the 1970s
to the present (Carol Armstrong, Homi Bhahba, T.J. Clark, Lee Edelman, Diana Fuss, Sander Gilman, Zine Magubane, Linda Nochlin, and Gayatri Spivak). We
will consider the relationship of Manet's and Courbet's works to academic ones, including orientalist paintings by Ingres and Grme, and to vanguard pictures of
the next generation (i.e. the homoerotic work of Caillebotte and Bazille, the "sex workers" of Degas's toilette scenes). Finally, we will examine the legacy of
Courbet and Manet during the period when difference began to be represented in the work of artists such as Judy Chicago, Yasumasa Morimura, Cindy Sherman,
Samuel Fosso, and Carrie Mae Weems.
Format: seminar. Requirements: weekly 1- to 2-page position papers; oral presentation and final research paper, 10-15 pages.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected:12). Preference may be given to students with course work in French

ARTH 432 Domestic Visual Culture in Renaissance Florence (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 432) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be
offered 2010-2011)
Fifteenth-century Florence nurtured a burgeoning culture of image production. This remarkable proliferation of images, and the rapid development of visual
idioms, has given the Tuscan city a privileged art historical position as the birthplace of the Renaissance and, traditionally, the basis of the first chapter in the story
of artistic development and progress in the west. The domestic palace, as it emerged during this period, was a crucial site for the production and reception of new
kinds of objects; indeed, many Renaissance touchstones--Botticelli's Birth of Venus, Leonardo's Mona Lisa, and Michelangelo's Doni Tondo, to name just a few
examples-were originally commissioned for (and viewed within) a domestic setting. In this course we will examine the Renaissance palace itself, as well as a
constellation of diverse images once housed within it including traditional panel paintings, painted furniture and wall-hangings, ceramics, and ritual objects. We
will pose questions about the relationship between these images and the people who commissioned them and lived with them, focusing especially on issues of
gender and power. Our investigation of domestic art will be grounded in the larger historiographic problem of Renaissance individualism; in other words, we will
use this material in order to consider, critique, and refine traditional conceptions of the Renaissance as a historical period.
Format: seminar. Requirements: evaluation will be based on oral participation and short response papers, one oral presentation, and a 15-20 page research paper.
Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to seniors.

ARTH 451 Ideal Bodies: The Modern Nude and Its Dilemmas (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 451) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be
offered 2010-2011)
The nineteenth century is so dominated by the female nude that the very term "nude" has come to stand for the female body. And yet, the history of the nude
during this period is not devoid of male bodies. This course looks at both male and female nudes in order to understand how the nude became gendered female.
Required readings include Kenneth Clark's classic study The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form (1956) and Lynda Nead's The Female Nude: Art, Obscenity and
Sexuality (1992), with special attention to texts which show how the nude and the discourse of the ideal function to obscure social issues. We will explore the ways
59
in which certain types of bodies have been defined in opposition to the white western ideal, and thereby exoticized or marginalized. Our prime focus is the work of
David, Ingres, Gricault, Courbet, Manet, and Renoir but more popular nineteenth-century images as well as selected works by artists working today will be
discussed.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on biweekly 1-page papers, short reports, an oral presentation and a 10- to 20-page paper.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102; permission of instructor required. Enrollment limited to 12. Preference given to junior Art majors, Women's and Gender Studies
majors and European History majors.

ARTH 461T(F) Writing about Bodies (Same as INTR 461 and Women's and Gender Studies 461) (W)
The goal is to think about describing bodies from a variety of disciplinary approaches and genres of writing. Its focus is on living bodies, or bodies that were once
alive, with an emphasis on bodies that move i.e., performing bodies--actors, dancers, singers--and what makes them unique. We will also consider objects
associated with bodies, and the ways they are animated, including how they are animated when the person who had them dies. The course is meant for juniors,
seniors, and graduate students who wish to analyze bodies from different disciplinary formations-art, theatre, literature, anthropology, philosophy--and who have
a particular interest in writing. We will read scholarly writing, fiction, New Yorker profiles, as well as memoir/autobiography, and take each as a model through
which to write about a person or an object redolent of a person.
Possible readings: Roland Barthes on cultural theory and representation; Zine Magubane and Zadie Smith on othered bodies; Tamar Garb on portraiture; Elaine
Scary on the body in pain; Joan Acocella, Hilton Als, Judith Thurman and other writers on the arts; Judith Butler and Peggy Phelan on the performative body;
Joseph Roach, Diana Taylor, and Michael Taussig on the body, memory, and ritual; Marvin Carlson and Terry Castle on haunting; and Bill Brown on things.
These will be supplemented by selected tapes of live performances as well as films.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: alternating weekly essays (4-5 pages) and responses (2-4 pages) as well as discussion; a final paper that distills the writer's own
project from these cumulative exercises.
Prerequisites: ArtH 101-102, or permission of the instructor; a writing sample that conveys the kind of subject you might be interested in pursuing. Enrollment

offered 2010-2011)
California has long been considered a land of "sunshine and noir," unique in the national and international imagination as a land of physical recreation and
destruction, a land of opportunity and social unrest. In this course, we will study the visual arts and culture of California from the 1960s to the present. Although
we will focus on southern California, particularly Los Angeles, we will also consider movements in San Diego and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Area. The
course will approach California pop, conceptual, funk, performance, installation, public, and media arts to pursue questions of influence and interpretation con-
cerning the relations between space, place, identity, and style in the visual arts and popular culture. Alongside analyzing California's visual culture, we will
examine the region's cultural geography through historical and theoretical readings. Particular attention will be given to the region's special relations to Holly-
wood, the automobile, beach-surf culture, and the great diversity that characterizes the state.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on two research papers and a presentation.

ARTH 463 The Holocaust Visualized (Same as Jewish Studies 463) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This seminar will examine how memories of the Holocaust have been conveyed through visual means and consider what historical, cultural and political circum-
stances have caused various nations to remember the Holocaust differently. We will discuss the issues prompted by public memorials, exhibitions and, as one
writer puts it, the "museumification" of concentration camps. How should we define the Holocaust? Whose memory should take precedence? What is lost or
gained by the inclusion of texts with images? How might memory be misrepresented by the exhibition of visual materials such as video testimony, photographs
and artifacts? In addition, we will study art about the Holocaust, including Art Spiegelman's graphic novel, Maus, and non-fiction films, such as Night and Fog,
Shoah and Schindler's List, to ask whether constructed or simulated images can convey the experience of the Holocaust as well as documentary ones. Additional-
ly, we need to consider ways in which the images of the Holocaust, by now too well-known, have been instrumentalized by groups wishing to minimize the
Shoah (e.g. the recent Holocaust cartoon competition in Tehran, 2006.)
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussion and regular participation in a class listserver discussion group, one oral presentation, and
one research paper; no exams.

be offered 2010-2011) (W) (D)
This course examines the contemporary history of Latina/o visual culture and explores the various relations between cultural expression, identity formation, and
public representation. We will begin by considering the critical and aesthetic practices that emerged in the context of civil rights actions and nationalist move-
ments, which often focused on issues of visibility, self-representation, and autonomy. The topics of immigration, transnationalism, and the "Latinization" of the
United States will then be analyzed in depth as we examine representations of and representations by Latina/os in film and television, the visual arts, advertising,
and other forms of popular media. Throughout the course, we will investigate the role of visual culture in determining taste and trends as well as shaping notions
of belonging and cultural citizenship.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a research presentation, several short writing assignments (1-2 pages), and a final research paper.
Prerequisites: LATS 105 or ArtH 101-102 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference given to Latina/o Studies and Art History

ARTH 470(S) American Orientalism, Then and Now
"Orientalism," according to Edward Said, refers to asymmetrical relationships between "East" and "West" by which the latter represents and controls the former.
This course is about the visual manifestations of those dynamics as they exist between the United States and the Islamic world during the period from 1870 to the
present; during this period, America emerged on the world stage, consumer culture coalesced and the mechanical reproduction of images became a formative
force in American visuality. With reference to painting, photography, film, advertising and fashion, we will explore the American Orientalism as it changes over
time in response to social and political circumstance.

ARTS 106(S) Topics in Nonfiction Film/Video (Same as American Studies 106)
"Certain people start with a documentary and arrive at fiction... others start with fiction and arrive at the documentary." --Jean Luc Godard. This course is a broad
survey of documentary (nonfiction) film and video history, theory and practice. We will use the term "documentary" as a loose construct to examine the ways in
which artists use the moving image to explore, represent, construct and change the world. A special emphasis will be placed on the outer limits of "documentary"
film: the places where its status and function as nonfiction is challenged or confused. Technical and aesthetic aspects of video production will be covered in a
cumulative series of workshops and exercises culminating in three short video projects.
Format: studio/workshop. Requirements: weekly response papers to video screenings and critical texts, three video production projects.

ARTS 310T Appearance/Disappearance (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Appearance and disappearance are conditions that intuitively and intellectually link a subject to its surrounding environment. We are made aware of things ap-
pearing (or disappearing) by the degrees and kinds of contrasts exhibited by the subject (ideas or objects) in relation to its ground (ephemeral or material). The
particular array of relationships between subject and ground constructs diverse kinds of evidence. From medical research in the imaging processes of the internal
body to the forensic cues offered by the "black box" in-flight recording; from the military use of camouflage to the video taped "appearances" of Osama bin
Laden; from the inability of an eating disorder patient to recognize a self image to the masquerades we willingly wear-appearance and disappearance have gov-
erned the evidences of our actions, beliefs and identities.
This image-based studio examination of the subject will look at material that has been shaped by its link with our central theme. Each of five studio projects will
successively build a cumulative view of how appearance and/or disappearance might shift a viewer's ability to render any point of view. While work in a variety
of media will be encouraged, most of the studio exercises will be two-dimensional or low-relief in their final presentation.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be on the basis of the technical and conceptual strengths of the portfolio, the weekly paired-student format and full class studio
discussions, and regular written analysis of work produced during this term. Lab fee.
Prerequisites: any one of the following: ArtS 230, 241, 242, 257, 263, or 264. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Preference given to Art majors. (Note: Students
only need to be available one hour during the stated time. Students who have time-conflicts with another course should contact the instructor.)
EPPING
ARTS 317T The Miniature (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This course will involve the critical analysis and production of works of art done on a small scale. If art on the largest scale is inherently public in nature, what is
the nature of the miniature? The miniature has fulfilled many functions: images of remembrance, the portrait of a beloved, devotional objects, art made as an
object of contemplation and wonder. The language of the miniature is intimate, private, and bears the authority of understatement. Our involvement with many
works of art is likely to be distanced, in time and in space. Our involvement with the miniature is close, highly personal, and frequent. Course assignments will
examine the inherent qualities of the work in miniature, and ask students to create work to fulfill historically defined and innovative functions. The assigned work
can be executed in any medium in which the student has completed an introductory course. Students will meet in pairs, together with the instructor, and the
students will present critical responses to the works in progress and upon completion. Readings will be assigned to focus this critical analysis. In addition to the
production of miniatures, each student will research and deliver critical presentations on related contemporary or historical works.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on the quality of the assigned work, the engagement in the critique process, and quality of presentations.
Prerequisites: any ArtS 200-level course. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to Art majors.

ARTS 322T(F) The Empowered Object
The development of "found objects" in the language of art have played a significant role in constructing meaning in the consciousness of the twenty -first century.
This tutorial will have students explore that tradition further through their own creative endeavors. They will be asked to add to the lineage of art that uses "found
63
objects" in a creative and meaningful way. They will have the freedom to choose which medium will convey their ideas most effectively. They include, but are not
limited to: sculpture, painting, drawing, photography, printmaking and video. For example, within the investigation of the "found object," projects could include:
still life painting with a focus on the objects, 2 -dimensional work depicting or incorporating real objects, collage, assemblage, etc. The "found object in art" will
be examined through: art practice, readings and presentations. Three projects will be completed. As a tutorial, the course is designed to meet individual needs and
to stress student participation and responsibility for learning. Students will meet weekly with a peer and the professor to review work.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation is based on the conceptual and technical quality of the work as well as the level of participation in the tutorial meetings. Lab fee.
Prerequisite: any 200-level art course housed soley in the studio wing of the art department. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

chroma key, lighting, live video switching and post-production. The studio exercises will culminate in an original half-hour program to be aired on Williamstown
Cable Access television locally and other broadcast contexts as determined by student research and interest. Possible content segments could include PSA/com-
mercial, editorial/news, music/performance or roundtable/debate.
Students will be expected to work in a highly independent manner. Evaluation will be based on independent initiative, growth in technical/conceptual production
skills, investment of time, participation in weekly studio sessions and attendance.
Prerequisites: at least one class in video production or permission of the instructor. Lab fee: $100-150. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preferences: Studio
Art, History and Practice, and Art History majors.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 T LANE
ARTS 329(F) Architectural Design II
This year the design studio investigates the process of conceiving and transforming ideas into architectural propositions and dynamically changing built environ-
ments. Design research assignments during site visits examine user-experience and ambiance, design theories and methodologies, real estate development and
cityscapes. Observational techniques are developed with hand drawings, photographs and videos as research tools. Several short design projects introduce scales
that range from the architectural drawing to the urban environment, from smart materials to advanced buildings. Students are encouraged to engage in multidisci-
plinary team work between users, investors, brand identity experts, builders and engineers.
Format: design studio, site visits, lectures, readings. Evaluation will be based on progress in developing creative problem solving skills and novel design solutions

ARTS 350T The BIG Picture (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Installation practices, scale changes and serial imagery are transforming our spatial experience and temporal understanding of the photographic image. The size of
photographic prints has grown enormously in the past thirty years. Photographs compete with paintings for white wall real estate. There are technological, eco-
nomic and aesthetic reasons for this dramatic change in scale. This course will address the conceptual and technical challenges of large format printing and the
making of large composites of photographs. Students will have an opportunity to work in a variety of media, both chemical and digital, dictated by the nature of
the ideas generated in tutorial sessions with colleagues. Lab fee.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on the portfolio produced and participation in the weekly tutorial meetings.
Prerequisites: ArtS 255, 256 or 252. Enrollment limit: 10.
LALEIAN
ARTS 364T(F) Artists' Books
This course will investigate the processes and ideas associated with the making of artists' books, works that are fine art objects that generally use visual images
and/or text. For example, individual projects could include visual diaries, three-dimensional pop-up books, solely visual narratives, autobiography, literary text/
image collaborations, animated "\"flip" books, or sculptural books. Limited-editions as well as one-of-a-kind work will be encouraged. Media options include
painting, drawing, etching, lithography, relief printing, photography and bookbinding techniques (from sewn bindings to boxes). As a tutorial, this course is
designed to support individual directions, to stress student participation and responsibility for learning, and to examine different points of view. Students will meet
in groups of two for critique of individual projects in the tutorial format each week--students are expected to give 20- to 30-minute presentations about their work
and to respond to questions and criticism. Students will also meet once a week as a group for demonstrations, lectures, and discussion of readings.

rich and varied offerings and believe that the need for most independent work can be met through those regular offerings.
Prerequisites: no student will be accepted into an independent study project unless he/she has completed two 200-level ArtS courses and one 300-level ArtS
tutorial. Permission of instructor is required.
GRADUATE COURSES IN ART HISTORY
Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts in Art History
To qualify for the Master of Arts degree in art history, candidates complete a minimum of eleven courses for graduate credit plus two winter study periods, the
latter consisting of a GP Study Trip in the first year (ARTH 51) and preparation of a Draft Qualifying Paper in the second (ARTH 52). Students must also
demonstrate reading proficiency in two foreign languages, one of which will be German (for more specific information on the language requirements, see below,
after the listing for ARTH 597/598). At the end of the second year, students present a shortened version of the Qualifying Paper in the annual Graduate Sympo-
sium. They deposit copies of the Symposium paper, augmented with scholarly apparatus and illustrations, in the Williams College Archives and the Clark Li-
brary.
At least seven of the eleven courses must be graduate seminars. Included in this number are two required of all students: ARTH 504, "Methods of Art History
and Criticism," to be taken during the first semester; and ARTH 509, "Graduate Student Symposium," to be taken during the fourth semester.
With permission of the Director, up to four undergraduate courses in fields pertinent to their course of study at the 200-, 300-, or 400-level may be taken for
graduate credit, with the understanding that research papers submitted in such courses meet a standard commensurate with those prepared for graduate seminars.
Students who wish to take undergraduate courses for graduate credit must receive permission of the instructor. In the case of undergraduate lecture courses,
students should register for them as ARTH 597 (in the fall) or ARTH 598 (in the spring). With the permission of the Director, one course in studio art may be
included among the four.
Beyond the two required seminars, students must fulfill a distribution requirement by the end of their course of study. At least one course must be taken in four
of six areas:
64
(1) East Asian, Indian, Islamic art
(2) Ancient Near Eastern, Egyptian, Greek, and Roman art
(3) Early Christian, Byzantine, and Western Medieval art to 1400
(4) Western art, 1400 to 1780
(5) Western art, 1780 to present
(6) Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas (Pre-Hispanic or Native American cultures)
With the approval of the Director, a thematic or non-period specific course may apply toward the distribution requirement, provided the student works substan-
tially and primarily on a topic that satisfies the requirement.
Private Tutorial
In addition to the regularly offered seminars and classes, students may apply to take courses designated as "Private Tutorials" (ARTH 595 in the fall semester,
ARTH 596 in the spring). Students wishing to register for a private tutorial should submit a petition to the Director describing the substance of the project and the
nature of the work to be submitted for evaluation, including a bibliography. The petition should be co-signed by the student and by the faculty instructor. Up to two
private tutorials may be accepted for credit. Of the minimum requirement of eleven courses, the combined number of private tutorials and undergraduate courses
applied to the degree may not exceed four.
The Qualifying Paper
The Qualifying Paper will normally take the form of a revision of a seminar or private tutorial paper produced in one of the previous three semesters, expanded
and refined so that it would meet the standard for publication. The student must submit the topic of the Qualifying Paper in writing to the Director by the final day
of classes of the third semester of study. Before submitting the topic, the student must obtain the seminar instructor/private tutorial supervisor's agreement to
supervise the Qualifying Paper.
No later than the first day of class of the Spring semester students submit three copies of a Draft Qualifying Paper, including illustrations, to the Director, the
Associate Director, and to the faculty supervisor or third reader. Although a draft, the paper should be brought to a high level of completion. The Draft Qualifying
Paper should not exceed 8,000 words, including footnotes and bibliography.
Within four weeks of submitting their Draft Qualifying Paper, students will meet with their readers for a Qualifying Paper Discussion (QPD), at which time
they will discuss revisions and modifications as appropriate. Students then submit the final version of the Qualifying Paper to the faculty supervisor and the
Program Director within 6 weeks of the QPD.
The Graduate Symposium
All students participating in the Symposium will be assigned an ad hoc committee to advise them in preparing their presentation. Each ad hoc committee will
include (but is not limited to) the Director of the Graduate Program, one additional faculty mentor, one first-year graduate student, and one second-year graduate
student. The first and third dry runs will be presented to the ad hoc committee. The second dry run will be presented to (and only to) the other second-year students
in a Dry Run Workshop scheduled by the GP. Speakers must bring copies of their paper to each dry run. To meet the time limit of twenty minutes, the text,
excluding footnotes, should not exceed 2,800 words. Students must submit the text of the final talk, augmented with notes, bibliography, list of illustrations, and a
250-word abstract, in hard and electronic copy to the Program for placement in the College Archives and the Clark Library.
Grades and Academic Standing
The Program uses the following grading system (numerical equivalent in computing grade averages):
A+ = truly exceptional (4.33) B = satisfactory (3.00)
A = outstanding (4.00) B- = barely adequate (2.67)
A- = excellent (3.67) C = inadequate (0)
B+ = good (3.33) E = failing (0)
Any course in which the student receives a grade below B- will not be accepted for graduate credit.
Letter grades are used in all seminars except ARTH 509. In language courses letter grades are kept on record in the Graduate Program Office but are converted
to Pass/Fail on the Williams transcript and are not averaged in with other grades. Winter Study courses (ARTH 51 and 52), and the Graduate Student Symposium
(ARTH 509) are graded on a Pass/Fail basis. At the end of the first year, each student's record will be reviewed by the Director of the GP. Those whose average for
the first two semesters is less than B (3.00) may be asked to resign from the Program. Failure to complete assigned work in a course by the end of the examination
period of the semester will result in a deficiency grade of E, unless an extension has been granted by the instructor, and in consultation with the Director. In cases
where an extension is granted, the student will receive a grade of "Incomplete" (Z). If the work is not completed by the agreed upon deadline, the grade will be
changed to an E. Please note: College policy allows extensions beyond the examination period only in the event of serious illness and with the approval of the
Dean. The Graduate Program permits extensions on less stringent grounds, by prior arrangement with the instructor, yet many instructors may choose to apply the
College's criteria to graduate students, especially in undergraduate courses. Students seeking an extension should consult the instructor before the beginning of the
examination period and at least one week before the announced deadline.
A student who resigns from the Graduate Program may, after an agreed upon term of not less than one year, submit a petition for re-admission to the Director.
Such a petition must include evidence that deficiencies have been remedied and that the student is capable of completing the course of study for the degree
without further interruption.
It is expected that the requirements for the degree will be completed within four semesters of residence. In no instance will credit be given for coursework done
prior to matriculation in the Graduate Program. The program is full-time and does not normally admit students on a part-time basis.
ARTH 500(F) Clark Visiting Professor Seminar: Painting and Magic (Same as ArtH 400)
Decades ago, Ernst Kris and Otto Kurz argued that the rise of pictorial illusionism in the West coincided with the refiguring of the artist as a kind of magus. This
course will revisit the connection Kris and Kurz drew, considering such topics as the role of wonder in Renaissance art collecting, the idea that images had
talismanic powers or miracle-working effects, the growing sense that artists were guided by a "genius" or "demon," and the aesthetics that developed around the
fear of "possession." The course will focus on Renaissance Europe but will look at recent literature from other fields.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, presentation of research, and a term paper of 20-25 pages.
Enrollment limit: 14, with places for 7 undergraduate [ARTH 400] and 7 graduate students [ARTH 500] assured. Preference given to senior Art History majors
and Graduate Program students.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 M COLE
ARTH 500(S) Clark Visiting Professor Seminar: Arte Povera (Same as ArtH 400)
In the 15th century, a number of Italian painters began to eliminate gold from their pictures, letting the works' value depend on their makers' skill rather than on
the cost of their materials. In the 16th century, Tintoretto adopted a manner of painting quickly with a restricted range of color so as to be able to win prominent
commissions and deliver them at low cost. In the 17th century, Caravaggio spurred imitation and provoked criticism with grimy-looking paintings that appeared
to feature poor models taken from the street. In more modern times, painters have assembled cheap, mass-produced materials directly into pictures. This course
will look at the "impoverishment of the image" as a strategy across time.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, presentation of research, and a term paper of 20-25 pages.
Enrollment limit: 14, with places for 7 undergraduate [ARTH 400] and 7 graduate students [ARTH 500] assured.
Preference given to senior Art History majors and Graduate Program students.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 M COLE
ARTH 501(S) Museums: History and Practice
This course will examine the history of museums in Europe and America, focusing on historical traditions and current expectations affecting institutional opera-
tions today. Historical tradition and current practice as it relates to museum governance and administration, architecture and installation, acquisitions and collec-
tions, cultural property issues as well as the many roles of exhibitions in museum programming will be addressed along with museums' social responsibility as
scholarly and public institutions in an increasingly market-driven, non-profit environment.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on oral presentations as well as two term papers.
Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to Graduate Program students and then to senior Art History majors.
Hour: 2:30-5:00 T CONFORTI
ARTH 502(F) Violence and Artistic Representation
Topics in the psychology, politics, and aesthetics of violence in artistic representation, from Lessing to the present day. A significant portion of the class touches on
19th-century art, but readings will be drawn from a range of fields and disciplines. Research projects in other fields welcome.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, presentation of research, and a term paper of 20-25 pages.
Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to Graduate Program students and then to senior Art History majors.

ARTH 504(F) Methods of Art History and Criticism
This is a seminar in the intellectual history of the history of art, with some concentration on the ways in which this disciplinary tradition has been challenged by
recent critical theory. It will begin its study with the "founders" of the field and end with issues and problems that generated the "new art history" twenty years ago
and "visual studies" in the last decade. Topics to be covered include: style, iconography/iconology, semiotics, identity politics, formalism, deconstruction, pheno-
menology, psychoanalysis, feminism, Marxism, and gender studies. Resident Clark Fellows will occasionally talk to us on perspectives of their choice.
Format: seminar. Each student will write one short midterm paper and a longer concluding essay, as well as present a couple of the readings to the class.
Limited to and required of first-year students in the Graduate Program in the History of Art.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 T HOLLY
ARTH 506(F) Nostalgia/Modernity: Landscape in Britain, France, and America, 1650-1900 and Beyond
This seminar rests on two suppositions, one a core principle, the other an assertion to be tested. The first part of the course, articulated through discussions of
readings and images (both real and virtual), will focus on the principle: that the primary mode of representing the "natural world" through a Western genre of art
called "landscape" developed in early modern Europe and remained relatively consistent for over two hundred years. We will explore the theoretical, critical, and
practical implications of this historical phenomenon. The second part of the seminar, developed through student presentations of research topics, tests the asser-
tion: that, despite seeming to undermine the traditions of "landscape," modern and contemporary European and American art, with its expanding vocabulary
(land art, earthworks, new media, etc.) and overt political dimension (ecological, environmental, etc.) nevertheless remains wedded in many ways to the frame-
work developed centuries before.
Format: seminar. Students will be evaluated on the basis of their participation in class, oral presentations, and final project (format to be determined; perhaps a
paper of 20-25 pages).
Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to Graduate Program students and then to senior Art History majors.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 R RAND
ARTH 508(S) Art and Conservation: An Inquiry into History, Methods, and Materials
This course is designed to acquaint students with observation and examination techniques for works of art, artifacts, and decorative arts objects; give them an
understanding of the history of artist materials and methods; and familiarize them with the ethics and procedures of conservation. This is not a conservation
training course but is structured to provide a broader awareness for those who are planning careers involving work with cultural objects.
Format: slide presentations, lectures, gallery talks, hands-on opportunities, technical examinations, and group discussions. Sessions will be held at the Williams-
town Art Conservation Center, Williams College, the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, and the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art
Collection in Albany. Examination questions may be formulated from exhibitions at these locations. Six exams will be given. Exams scores will be weighed in
proportion to the number of sessions covered by the exam (e.g., the paintings exam, derived from six sessions of the course, will count as 25% of the final grade).
There is no overall final exam.
Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to Graduate Program students and then to senior Art History majors.
Hour: 6:30-8:30 MR BRANCHICK and WACC staff
ARTH 509(S) Graduate Symposium
This course is designed to assist qualified fourth-semester graduate students in preparing a scholarly paper to be presented at the annual Graduate Symposium.
Working closely with a student/faculty ad hoc advisory committee, each student will prepare a twenty-minute presentation based on the Qualifying Paper. Special
emphasis is placed on the development of effective oral presentation skills.
Format: symposium. Requirements: each student will present three dry runs and a final oral presentation at the symposium.
Prerequisites: successful completion and acceptance of the Qualifying Paper.
Limited to and required of second-year students in the Graduate Program in the History of Art.
Hour: TBA GOTLIEB
ARTH 544(S) History Painting
This course is about the genre known as History Painting, which since the Renaissance, and particularly after the founding of the French Academy of Painting
and Sculpture, came to be perceived as the most complex and noblest genre of painting. The course asks about how and why history painting emerged as a
category, what its rules were, and why they mattered. It also explores history painting in its historical development, with a particular focus on the moment (rough-
ly) between 1650-1850 when the category bore the most weight and significance, and will not shy away from moments (like the period of the French Revolution)
when the relationship between history painting as istoria and the historical process was most dynamic and problematic. It will explore the work of painters from
Raphael to Poussin and Rubens to David, West, Hogarth, Reynolds, Ingres, and Delacroix.
Format: seminar. Assessment will be on the basis of oral presentation (normally focused on an individual painting or group of paintings) and one research paper
(20-25 pages). In addition, students will be expected to lead discussions of readings and to respond to the presentations of others in the class.
Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to Graduate Program students and then to senior Art History majors.
Hour: 2:30-5:00 W LEDBURY
ARTH 554(S) The Matrix and the Market: Printmaking and Photography in the Late Nineteenth Century
During the last half of the 19th century, technical, commercial, and aesthetic approaches to printmaking and photography experienced dramatic paradigm shifts.
Etching, for example, simultaneously functioned as a reproductive medium and one that carried experimental, vanguard associations. Practitioners of lithography
strove to distance themselves from denigrating commercialism and raise the medium's status to a respected art form. Photography, in turn, negotiated the bound-
aries between "documentary" and "artistic." This seminar will address the complex issues that swirled around printmaking and photographic matrices, critical
responses to the various processes, artist-driven initiatives, and the formative role of the art market and book trade in shaping popular opinion. We will consider
these topics across political and geographic borders from Europe to the United States, reading both primary and secondary sources. The class will be held in the
study room of the Clark's department of prints, drawings, and photographs, with visits to the Clark and Chapin libraries and the Williams College Museum of Art
likely.
Format: seminar. Students will be responsible for readings and involved class discussion, several short and one long presentation, and a final paper (20-25 pages).
Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to Graduate Program students and then to senior Art History majors.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 R CLARKE
ARTH 555(F) John Singer Sargent
In this seminar we will consider the life and art of John Singer Sargent (1856-1925). Paintings in the collection of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute will
focus our discussions and provide the basis for exploring his art-making and his place within the art-culture of his day. Sargent--born in Italy, trained in France,
active in England--epitomized the cosmopolitanism of American artists in the late 19th century. Consideration of his career will encourage us to think about
questions of nationality; the mechanisms of fame in the modern art world; the tension between the lures of artistic tradition and innovation; and the fluctuating
taste for his art among critics, collectors, and historians of the past century.
Format: seminar. Students' responsibilities will include class discussion, weekly summaries of readings, two short papers, an oral presentation (and response to
someone else's), and a final research paper (20-25 pages). A field trip to Boston is likely.
Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to Graduate Program students and then to senior Art History majors.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 F SIMPSON
ARTH 569(S) Film as Art: Cinema in the Weimar Republic
This seminar will explore the attempt, in Weimar writing on film and film production itself, to raise the status of cinema from a low-brow mass entertainment
medium to a visual art form worthy to stand alongside traditional painting. As the critic Rudolf Arnheim argued in Film als Kunst (1931), "in film one continues to
work with the means and devices of traditional art, [and] one can speak just as seriously about Charlie Chaplin, Greta Garbo, editing, and panning as one does
about Titian, Czanne, Baroque, and pleinairism." Among directors, F. W. Murnau studied art history at university, Fritz Lang began as a painter and sculptor in
Vienna; they and other filmmakers availed themselves of the services of painters and established architects for the creation of film sets. The seminar will focus
precisely on this constitution of film as a primarily visual medium in which, to paraphrase Arnheim, the most profound content was conveyed by light, framing,
physiognomy, and editing, against which the word and the often kitschy or hackneyed story line remained secondary. While the primary focus of the seminar will
be the work of German directors, we shall also examine the work of filmmakers of other nationalities who were passionately committed to raising film to the level
of high art: for example, the Russian Sergei Eisenstein, whose Battleship Potemkin was a major cinema event in Germany, and the Dane Carl Theodor Dreyer,
who directed three films there. Topics to be examined include: "Expressionism" in film, Weimar film theory and criticism, the physiognomic paradigm, the
transition from silent film to sound film, as well as case studies of specific films. During the first half of the semester there will be weekly readings in English with
occasional short source readings in German, hence a reading knowledge of German is desirable but not required.
Format: seminar. Requirements: students will be responsible for an oral report, to be presented in revised, written form at semester's end, and a 10-minute critical
commentary on another student's oral report.
Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to Graduate Program students and then to senior Art History majors.

ARTH 597(F), 598(S) Undergraduate Lecture Course Taken for Graduate Credit
LANGUAGE COURSES
The Graduate Program's degree requirements include reading competence in two languages, other than English, of high scholarly and academic relevance to
the history of art. One of the two languages must be German. Many students select French as their second language. The Program offers dedicated courses in
reading French and German for art history. With permission from the Director or Associate Director, it is possible to substitute another language for French. For
other languages taught at Williams see the College Course Catalog, although please note that students may face difficulty juggling undergraduate and graduate
schedules.
Incoming students' language preparation is assessed through exams administered at the outset of the semester. The scores attained determine a student's place-
ment within the two-semester French/three-semester German sequence. If students have already completed extensive language study and attain a minimum score
of 700 on the placement exam, they are exempted from the requirement. With a score between 500 and 700, they are placed into the graduate course of readings in
art history, French 512 /German 513. With a score below 500, they enroll in French 511, offered in the fall for the graduate students / the appropriate one of two
semesters of German study (511 and 512) before advancing to the reading course. In the case of languages other than French, arrangements will be made on an
individual basis.
Returning second-year students who have completed GERM 511-512 have the option of taking a non-standardized two-hour reading exam in German as an
alternative to GERM 513. This option is intended for students who, following completing GERM 512, are able to enhance their German reading skills over the
summer following their first year. Should a student not pass the translation exam, s/he must register for GERM 513.
To satisfy the language requirement for the degree, a student must either score 700 or better on the SAT II reading examination in the chosen languages upon
matriculation or complete with a grade of B- or better the advanced course or courses (GERM 513, RLFR 512, or the equivalent in an approved alternative
language).
GERM 511(F)-512(S) Reading German for Beginners (Same as German 111(F)-112(S))
German 511-512 is for students whose principal reason for acquiring German is to work with written materials. It is particularly appropriate for students majoring
in fields in which the ability to read primary and secondary texts in German can be crucial, such as Art History, Comparative Literature, History, Music, Philoso-
phy, Political Science, and Theatre. In the first semester students learn the elements of grammar and acquire a core vocabulary. In the second semester, while
covering advanced grammatical topics, they practice reading in a variety of textual genres in the humanities and social sciences. They also learn how to work with
dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference works, in both printed and online forms. By the end of the course they will have a solid foundation for building
proficiency in German, whether through self-study or further course work. Credit granted only on successful completion of 512.
Format: lecture and discussion. Principal requirements: written homework, quizzes, tests, active class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15). Preference given to Graduate Program students, seniors and juniors.
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF B. KIEFFER
GERM 513(F) Readings in German Art History and Criticism
This is an advanced course in German reading, focused on the literature of Art History. Texts are selected from fundamental works of art history and criticism and
from writings related to concurrent seminars in the Graduate Program in the History of Art. The course includes a grammar review.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on written homework, quizzes, tests, and class participation.
Prerequisites: German 511-512 or equivalent preparation (a score of 500 or higher on the SAT II German Reading Test). Enrollment limited to Graduate Program
students; others by permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 12).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF E. KIEFFER
RLFR 511(F) Intensive Grammar and Translation
Emphasis will be on a thorough and systematic review of sentence structures and grammar. Students will learn to decipher the subtleties of the written language,
and as they become more confident, they will start translating a variety of short excerpts. Students are also expected to learn and develop a wide lexical range
centered on art history and criticism, but not limited to it.
Format: Classes meet twice weekly and are conducted in English. Evaluation will be based on class participation, papers, a midterm, and a final examination.
Prerequisites: none. A student may start such course with little knowledge of French but a resolute interest in learning how to read it. Enrollment is open for
Graduate Program students; undergraduates are welcome, by instructor's permission.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR DESROSIERS
RLFR 512(S) Readings in French Art History and Criticism
This course will provide Graduate Program students and interested others with knowledge of French acquired through translation and interpretation.
The core of this course is based on the reading and translating of a variety of critical works covering different periods and genres in the field of art history. The
material read (excerpts from museum catalogues; the Gazette des Beaux-Arts; Salons by Diderot, Baudelaire, or Thor; and authors such as Francastel, Valery,
Focillon, Derrida--to name a few), will be analyzed in form and content, translated or summarized, in order to develop the skills and understand the techniques
necessary for reading French. Grammar will be reviewed in context.
Format: seminar. Evaluation is based on class participation, papers, a midterm, and a final examination.
Prerequisite: French 511 or permission of instructor.

ASIAN STUDIES (Div. I & II, see explanation below)
Chair, Associate Professor CECILIA CHANG
Professors: KUBLER, YAMADA. Associate Professors: CHANG, KAGAYA, YAMAMOTO. Assistant Professors: NUGENT**, YU*. Adjunct
Faculty: Professors: CRANE**, DREYFUS, JANG, JUST, W. A. SHEPPARD, WONG*. Associate Professors: C. BOLTON, SINIAWER. Assis-
tant Professors: JOSEPHSON, A. REINHARDT*, VALIANI*. Visiting Assistant Professor: GUTSCHOW. Language Fellows: KUO, LU.
The mission of the Department of Asian Studies is to help as many students as possible--both majors and non-majors--develop practical proficiency in Asian
languages and, in the tradition of the liberal arts, acquire a meaningful understanding of important facets of one or more of the disciplines represented within
Asian Studies (including anthropology, art history, economics, history, linguistics, literature, music, political science, religion, and sociology), so that they may
realize their fullest intellectual and personal potential and be able to make useful contributions to society.
We offer courses in English in the field of Asian Studies as well as courses in Chinese and Japanese language, literature, and culture. Three distinct majors are
offered: a major in Chinese; a major in Japanese; and an interdisciplinary Asian Studies major which allows students to choose from a wide range of courses in the
anthropology, art, economics, history, languages, linguistics, literatures, music, politics, religion, and sociology of China,Taiwan, Japan, and other Asian coun-
tries. Students with questions about the Asian Studies majors or about Asian Studies course offerings should consult the chair. Please note: Courses with ASST
prefix carry Division II credit and courses with CHIN and JAPN prefixes carry Division I credit unless otherwise noted.
THE MAJOR
All students wishing to major in the Department of Asian Studies are required to take and pass a total of eleven courses, as follows:
1) Asian Studies 201 or, with permission of the Chair, students may select a substitute course that treats more than a single Asian country
2) four semesters of Chinese or Japanese language (including no more than two 100-level courses)
In addition to completing (1) and (2) above, all majors choose either an Area Studies track, leading to a major in Asian Studies; or a Language Studies track,
leading to a major in Chinese or Japanese. The requirements for each of these tracks are indicated below:
3A) Asian Studies Major
a. a three-course qualification in one of the disciplines represented within Asian Studies (anthropology/sociology, art history, economics, history, linguistics,
literature, music, political science, religion). The qualification, to be determined through consultation between students and their advisor, normally includes
an introductory course, a more advanced methodological or comparative course, and a course on Asia.
b. three approved electives, which may include further language work
3B) Chinese Major
a. four additional semesters of Chinese language (300-level or higher)
b. Chinese 412
c. one approved course in Chinese literature or culture in translation
3C) Japanese Major
a. four additional semesters of Japanese language
b. one course in Japanese literature in translation
c. one elective on Japan
STUDY ABROAD
Students intending to major in Asian Studies are encouraged to study in Asia during one or both semesters of their junior year. Williams faculty serve on the
boards of several study abroad programs in China and Japan. Opportunities to study in India, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan,Thailand, and other Asian countries are
also available. Prospective Asian Studies majors who are planning to study abroad should discuss their plans with their advisor as far in advance as possible. Up to
eight courses taken overseas can count toward graduation, and up to four courses taken off campus may be counted toward the major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
Students interested in writing an honors thesis in Asian Studies, Chinese, or Japanese should submit a proposal to the department chair when they register for
courses in the spring of their junior year. The proposal should include a statement of the topic, a general description of the types of materials available for study
and how the study will be carried out, and the name of the faculty member who will serve as advisor. Admission to the honors thesis program will normally be
limited to students who have maintained at least a B+ average in their courses for the major.
Students admitted to the program should register for ASST 493-W31-494, CHIN 493-W31-494, or JAPN 493-W31-494. They will be expected to turn in the
final draft of their thesis shortly after spring break and to discuss their results formally with their faculty graders. Their final grades in the three courses listed above
and the award of Honors, Highest Honors, or no honors will be determined by the quality of the thesis and the student's performance in the oral defense.
THE ASIAN STUDIES ENDOWMENT
The Linen summer grants for study abroad, the Linen visiting professorships, and several other programmatic activities in the department are supported by an
endowment for Asian Studies established by family and friends in memory of James A. Linen III, Class of 1934, Trustee of the College from 1948 to 1953 and
from 1963 to 1982.

COURSES IN CHINESE (Div. I)
The department regularly offers four levels of instruction in Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin), designed to enable the student to become proficient in aural
comprehension, speaking, reading, and writing, as well as introductory courses in Cantonese, Taiwanese, Classical Chinese, and Chinese linguistics. The course
numbering system for Chinese is sequential. Students move from Chinese 101-102 to 201, 202, 301, 302, 401, and 402. Independent study (Chinese 497, 498)
may be offered depending on student needs and available resources. Those students entering with proficiency in Chinese should see the Coordinator concerning
placement.
The department also offers courses on Chinese literature and culture in English translation for students who wish to become acquainted with the major
achievements in Chinese literary, intellectual and cultural history. For the purpose of the distribution requirement, all courses in Chinese are considered Division I
unless otherwise noted.
STUDY ABROAD
Students majoring in Chinese are strongly encouraged to study in mainland China or Taiwan during one or both semesters of their junior year, during the
summer, or over Winter Study. It is important that students interested in any of these options consult as early as possible with the department and the Dean's Office
concerning acceptable programs.
CHIN 101(F)-W88-102(S) Basic Chinese (D)
An introduction to Mandarin, the language with the largest number of native speakers in the world, which is the official language of China and Taiwan, and one of
the official languages of Singapore. Course objectives are for the student to develop simple, practical conversational skills and acquire basic proficiency in reading
and writing in both the traditional and the simplified script at about the 500-character level. The relationship between language and culture and the sociolinguisti-
cally appropriate use of language will be stressed throughout. Both audio and video materials will be employed extensively.
Format of spoken classes: dialog performance, drills, communicative exercises. Format of written classes: oral reading, questions and discussion in Chinese,
translation and explanation in English. Evaluation is based on classroom performance, homework, quizzes, unit tests, and an oral and written final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 14 per section (expected: 14 per section). Preference given to first-years and sophomores.
Credit granted only if both semesters and the winter study sustaining program are taken.

CHIN 131 Basic Cantonese (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
An introduction to Standard Cantonese, a major regional language of southern China which is spoken by over 50 million people in Hong Kong, Macao, Guang-
dong, and Guangxi as well as by many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, Hawaii, and North America. Due to the pervasive influence of Hong Kong as well as
the economic transformation of Guangdong Province, the prestige of Cantonese within China has been rising steadily over the past few decades. Our focus in this
course will be on developing basic listening and speaking skills, though we will also study some of the special characters which have been used for centuries to
write colloquial Cantonese. Since students will ordinarily possess prior proficiency in Mandarin, a closely related language, we should be able to cover in one
semester about as much as is covered in the first two to three semesters of Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 202 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8).
KUBLER
CHIN 152 Basic Taiwanese (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
An introduction to Taiwanese, the majority language of Taiwan. Different varieties of this language, which is also known as Amoy, Southern Min, Hokkien, and
Fukienese, are spoken by over 60 million people in Taiwan, southern Fujian, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Suppressed by the Japanese
from 1895-1945 and by the KMT Chinese government from 1945 through the 1970s, Taiwanese--in both its spoken and written forms--has been experiencing
a fascinating revival in recent years. This language, which is the most divergent of all the major Chinese "dialects," is of special linguistic interest because it has
preserved a number of features of Old Chinese. Our focus will be on developing basic listening and speaking skills, though we will also study some of the special
characters used to write Taiwanese. Since students in the course will ordinarily possess prior proficiency in Mandarin, a related language, we should be able to
cover in one semester about as much as is covered in the first two semesters of Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 202 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8).
KUBLER
CHIN 201(F), 202(S) Intermediate Chinese (D)

CHIN 219 Popular Culture in Modern China (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This course adopts a generic approach to introducing students to a variety of forms of popular culture in modern and contemporary China. The forms of popular
culture studied include popular readings (fiction, newspapers, magazines), advertisements, propaganda posters, popular music, television shows, film, and popu-
lar religious movements. We will explore such themes as the definitions of "popular culture," globalization and cultural trends, the encoding and decoding strate-
gies of a popular "text," as well as the political, ideological and sociological messages behind a popular "text." All readings in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on in-class participation, oral presentations, two short response papers, one midterm, and one final research
project.
No prerequisites. No Chinese language required, though students with Chinese language background are encouraged to work with Chinese sources if they wish.
No enrollment limit: (expected: 15). Open to all.

CHIN 223 Ethnic Minorities in China: Past and Present (Same as Anthropology 223) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (D)
By 2000, of the 1.3 billion population of China, more than 100 million were ethnic minorities (shaoshu minzu). Most of these reside in autonomous regions and
districts, which constitute 64% of China's total acreage. This course introduces students to the multiethnic aspect of China's past and present. We will address
topics such as the minority-group identification project; the definition of minzu; government policy toward and the current situation of the fifty-five official ethnic
minority groups; historical sino-centric views about "foreigners" and "barbarians"; ideas of "diversity," "unity," and "sinicization"; and the roles that "barbarians"
have played in China's long history. All readings will be in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on in-class participation and presentations, two short response papers, one mid-term, and one final paper.
No prerequisites. No knowledge of Chinese language required, though students with Chinese language background are encouraged to work with Chinese sources
if they wish. No enrollment limit (expected: 15). Open to all. Satisfies one semester of Division II distribution requirement.

CHIN 224(F) Cultural Foundations: The Literature and History of Early China (Same as Comparative Literature 220 and History 315) (D)
The early history of China witnessed many of humankind's most influential accomplishments, from the development of a civil bureaucracy to the invention of
printing, the compass, and gunpowder. It also saw the composition and spread of literary works and styles that continue to be both read and emulated up to the
present day not only in China but throughout the world. The acute awareness of early history and literature that runs through modern Chinese culture, in its many
manifestations and locales, is arguably unrivaled in the modern world. To understand modern China, one must understand the past that continues to shape it today.
The traditional view in China was that "literature, history and philosophy cannot be separated." Accordingly, this course will look at both the history and literature
of China from the 2nd millennium B.C. to the late 13th century A.D. In a typical week we will first read and discuss scholarship on the history and culture of a
given historical period. In the following class we will read selections of primary writings (in English translation) from the same period and analyze them in their
historical and cultural context. These writings will range from poems and short narratives to philosophical works and political tracts. Our goal is to understand not
only what modern scholarship says about early China, but what the people living in that period and culture had to say about themselves and their world. This is an
EDI course and wil examine in depth the diverse cultural forces that have historically played a part in China's self-definition. All readings in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: three short papers (1700-2300 words), and final exam. Participation in class discussions expected.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 15). Open to all.

CHIN 235 China on Screen (Same as Comparative Literature 235) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
From short films shown in teahouses in the late 19th century to international blockbusters in the early 21st, Chinese films have served as an important medium for
both the internal development of Chinese cultures and the presentation of those cultures to the world. In this course we will survey a wide range of works from
socially progressive films of the 1930s and 1940s to the martial arts hits of the last decade. These will include not only films from mainland China, but from Hong
Kong and Taiwan as well. We will use these films as a way to talk about such issues as visual culture, nationalism, technology, sexuality, social change, and the
representation of China on the world stage. All readings are in English and all films are subtitled in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: one short paper (5-7 pages), one longer paper (10-12 pages), take-home midterm, and final exam. Participation in class
discussions expected.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference to Asian Studies majors and then to juniors and seniors.

CHIN 251T(S) Crises and Critiques: The Literature and Intellectual History of Early 20th Century China (Same as Comparative Literature
256T and History 215T) (W) (D)
The first fifty years of the 20th century saw unprecedented changes in almost every sphere of Chinese society. A political system that had survived in some form
for over two millennia abruptly disintegrated. New ideas challenged orthodox intellectual culture in profound and complex ways. Chinese intellectuals ques-
tioned the value of inherited traditions while simultaneously facing the real possibility of the near total extinction of those traditions. Literature, which had histori-
cally been an important locus of cultural debates, served this role to perhaps an even greater extent during this tumultuous period, as writers struggled with
questions of how to save a country and culture wracked by internal disintegration and facing urgent external threats. These debates framed many of the issues that
continue to influence the political, intellectual, and literary cultures of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan to this day. In this course we will examine a
broad range of sources that engage the key debates of this period. This is an EDI course in which we will address such questions as the role of traditional culture
versus that of modern or Western culture, the role of ideology and politics in literary and artistic production, ideas of nationhood and cultural identity, and the
relationship between the individual and the state. All readings will be in English translation.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Every other week the student will write and present orally a
5- to 7-page paper on the assigned topic of that week. In alternative weeks, the student will write a 2-page critique of the fellow student's paper. There will also be
a final paper dealing with the issues addressed during the course. Evaluation will be based on written work and analysis of the fellow student's work.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to Chinese majors.
Tutorial meetings to be arranged. NUGENT
CHIN 301(F), 302(S) Upper-Intermediate Chinese (D)
Although the oral skills will continue to receive attention, there is at this level increased emphasis on reading and writing. A major goal of the course will be
developing students' reading proficiency in standard written Chinese, the grammar and vocabulary of which differ considerably from the colloquial written
Chinese which was introduced during the first two years of instruction. About half of the course will be devoted to newspaper reading, with the remainder consist-
ing of several modules that may include short selections from modern Chinese fiction, films, or other types of performance literature. Both simplified and tradi-
tional character texts will be used. Conducted in Mandarin.
Requirements: three 50-minute classes plus a conversation session; primarily reading and discussion; students are required to write a short essay every other
week. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, quizzes, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 202 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10.

CHIN 352 Bridging Theory and Practice: Learning and Teaching Chinese as a Second Language (Same as Linguistics 383) (Not offered
2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This course introduces students to the principles of second language acquisition (SLA), a field of study that investigates how people learn a foreign language and
provides a basis for understanding research related to foreign language learning and teaching. Theoretical issues to be covered include what it means to know a
language, how one becomes proficient in a foreign language, factors that affect the learning process, and the role of one's native language. We will also examine
what SLA research has discovered about teaching grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary, and writing. The goal is to explore ways in which SLA theories can be
applied to facilitate acquisition of Chinese in terms of learning strategies and curriculum design. This course will be useful to both students who want to improve
their own learning of Chinese and those who plan to teach or conduct research on Chinese. All readings in English with some examples in Chinese.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several oral presentations and short papers, and a final research project.
Prerequisites: Chinese 101 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 8).

CHIN 412(F) Introduction to Classical Chinese
Classical or "Literary" Chinese was the standard written language of China from around the seventh century BC until the 1920s and served for many centuries as
an important written language in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam as well. Moreover, remnants of Classical Chinese are still used frequently in Modern Chinese, in
both writing (e.g., newspaper, road signs and academic writing) and speech (e.g., proverbs and aphorisms). This course will serve as an introduction to the basic
grammar and vocabulary of Classical Chinese. We will focus on philosophical, political, and historical anecdotes from works from the Spring and Autumn period
(770-481 B.C.) through the Han Dynasty (202 B.C. -220 A.D.), as they served as the foundation for the language. While the main objective is to develop reading
proficiency in Classical Chinese, the course will also serve to enhance proficiency in Modern Chinese through classroom discussion in Mandarin, translation of
Classical Chinese into Modern Chinese, and comparison of Classical Chinese and Modern Chinese vocabulary and grammar. Conducted primarily in Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, tests, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chinese 302 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).

CHIN 413(S) Intermediate Classical Chinese: Ideas of Authority in Classical Chinese Literature
This course builds on the base of vocabulary and grammar established in Chinese 412 to introduce students to a much broader range of Classical Chinese texts
and genres. The works we will read include poetic, philosophical, and historical texts that all deal in some way with evolving ideas of authority in the Chinese
tradition. Our focus in this course will be not only on careful translation and grammatical analysis of these texts, but also on the ideas they express and the different
rhetorical and linguistic modes they use to construct their arguments. Students will also be introduced to the major dictionaries and other resources for reading and
translating Classical Chinese. All primary readings will be in Classical Chinese. Translation will be primarily into English and classroom discussion will be in
English. However, students are expected to have sufficient proficiency in modern Chinese to read commentaries and notes on the texts written in that language.
Format: translation and discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, quizzes, tests, a final exam, and a final translation project.
Prerequisites: Chinese 412 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected:15).

CHIN 431 Introduction to Chinese Linguistics (Same as Linguistics 403) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Is Chinese--whose nouns "lack" number and whose verbs have no tense--a monosyllabic, "primitive" language? Are the Chinese characters a system of logical
symbols or "idiographs," which indicate meaning directly without regard to sound? Should (and could) the characters be done away with and alphabetized? Are
Cantonese, Hakka, and Taiwanese dialects or languages? And what is the relationship between Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese? These are some of
the questions we will be taking up in this one-semester introduction to the scientific study of the Chinese language. Topics to be covered include: the phonological,
syntactical, and lexical structure of Modern Standard Chinese; the Chinese writing system; the modern Chinese dialects; the history of the Chinese language;
sociolinguistic aspects of Chinese; and language and politics in the Chinese-speaking countries. Readings in English and Chinese, with class discussion primarily
in Mandarin.
Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, homework, two short papers, and one longer paper.
Prerequisites: Chinese 302 or permission of instructor.

rate, aging and senior care--these are some of the issues actively discussed and debated in contemporary Japanese society. This course explores ways in which
these and other societal phenomena are depicted through literature, film, and other media, and thereby probes questions at the crossroads of popular/youth-cul-
ture, national identity, and the shifting narratives of minority and gender. All readings, discussions, films, and other media will be in English, or subtitled in

JAPN 252(F) The Masks of Japanese Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 252) (D)
From the masks of the noh theater to science fiction fantasies of plastic surgery and cyborg identity, this course examines the device of the mask in modern
Japanese fiction, as well as some of its premodern antecedents. The fictional masks we will look at range from the traditional to the technological, from the actual
to the metaphorical, from the physical to the purely psychological. But all of them are used by the authors to explore the nature of identity, and the significance of
concealing or revealing the self, either in fiction or face to face. This course considers diversity by giving careful thought to the nature of personal and cultural
identity, and to how different individuals express those identities through language. Readings will include modern novels and short stories by Abe Kb, Enchi
Fumiko, End Shsaku, Kurahashi Yumiko, Mishima Yukio, Tanizaki Jun'ichir, and Oscar Wilde. Visual texts will include noh and puppet theater, avant-garde
film by Teshigahara Hiroshi, comics by Tezuka Osamu, and animation by Oshii Mamoru. The class and the readings are in English. No familiarity with Japanese
language or culture is required.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: in-class exam, ungraded creative project, and two short papers (5-7 pages each) emphasizing original, creative, and
convincing readings of the class texts.

JAPN 254 Japanese Literature and the End of the World (Same as Comparative Literature 264) (Not offered 2009-2010)
From the endemic warfare of the medieval era to the atomic bombing and the violent explosion of technology in the last century, the end of the world is an idea
which has occupied a central place in almost every generation of Japanese literature. Paradoxically, the spectacle of destruction has given birth to some of the most
beautiful, most moving, and most powerfully thrilling literature in the Japanese tradition. Texts may be drawn from medieval war narratives like The Tale of the
Heike; World War II fiction and films by Ibuse Masuji, Imamura Shhei, and Ichikawa Kon; fantasy and science fiction novels by Abe Kb, Murakami Haruki
and Murakami Ry; and apocalyptic comics and animation by Oshii Mamoru, tomo Katsuhiro and Takahata Isao. The class and the readings are in English; no
familiarity with Japanese language or culture is required.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: in-class exam, ungraded creative project, and a few short response assignments, plus two 5- to 7-page papers empha-
sizing original, creative readings of the literary texts.

JAPN 255 Love and Death in Modern Japanese Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 255) (Not offered 2009-2010) (D)
The initial thing that surprises many first-time readers of modern Japanese fiction is its striking similarity to Western fiction. But equally surprising are the intrigu-
ing differences that lie concealed within that sameness. This course investigates Japanese culture and compares it with our own by reading Japanese fiction about
two universal human experiences--love and death--and asking what inflections Japanese writers give these ideas in their work. The course begins with tales of
doomed lovers that were popular in the eighteenth century kabuki and puppet theaters, and that still feature prominently in Japanese popular culture, from comics
to TV dramas. From there we move on to novels and films that examine a range of other relationships between love and death, including parental love and
sacrifice, martyrdom and love of country, sex and the occult, and romance at an advanced age. We will read novels and short stories by canonical modern authors
like Tanizaki, Kawabata, and Mishima as well as more contemporary fiction by writers like Murakami Haruki; we will also look at some visual literature, includ-
ing puppet theater, comics, animation, and Japanese New Wave film.
The class and the readings are in English. No familiarity with Japanese language or culture is required.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: In-class exam, ungraded creative project, and two short papers (5-7 pages each) emphasizing original, creative, and
convincing readings of the class texts.

JAPN 256 Confession and Deception in Japanese Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 266) (Not offered 2009-2010)
Situated at the origins of Japanese literature are the beautiful and revealing diaries of ladies in waiting of the tenth-century imperial court. Since that time, Japanese
literary tradition has placed great value on confessional writing of many kinds, from Sei Shnagon's classical Pillow Book and the haiku master Bash's eigh-
teenth-century travel diaries to postwar autobiographical fiction by writers like Mishima and Tanizaki. The source of interest in many of these texts lies in their
combination of self-revelation and concealment or deception. This course asks what it meant for these authors to write from their own experience, and also what
new things we can reveal in their work by writing about it ourselves. The class and the readings are in English; no familiarity with Japanese language or culture is
required.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: in-class exam, ungraded creative project, and a few short response assignments, plus two 5- to 7-page papers empha-
sizing original, creative readings of the literary texts.

Japan's rich and varied performance traditions, old and new, born of different historical settings, coexist to this day and compete for the attention of audiences,
domestically and abroad. The forms to be considered (Nohgaku, Kabuki, Bunraku, Shingeki and Butoh, among others) are all dynamic. Each has transformed
itself in response to evolving social conditions. This course examines these performance traditions, considers how each reflects the social, cultural, and political
context of its birth, and poses the question: "Of what relevance is this to a contemporary audience?" Some of the other questions we will explore include: How
have these performing traditions transformed themselves throughout history? What do we mean by `traditional' vs. `contemporary'? How are traditional and
contemporary performance genres interacting with each other? And how have the central themes of these works evolved? All readings and discussion will be in
English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, presentations, written journals, two short papers, and one longer paper.

Japan has captured the imagination of many writers and readers, including those who write and read from a distance and in languages other than Japanese. What
motivates one to write about Japan from beyond its borders? What attracts readers to such works? How do the motives of writers and readers cross? How do such
real or conceptual gaps frame our understanding? We will be reading works by Ruth Benedict, Donald Richie, Kazuo Ishiguro, Yoko Tawada, Haruki Murakami
and others. All readings, discussions, and films will be in English, or subtitled in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, presentations, written journals, two short essays, and one longer paper.
No prerequisites. Open to all. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). Preference given to Japanese, Asian Studies, and Comparative Literature majors.

JAPN 276 Premodern Japanese Literature and Performance (Same as Comparative Literature 278) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be
offered 2010-2011)
Some of Japan's performance traditions, which developed in different historical settings, have survived to this day and continue to coexist and compete for the
attention of audiences both domestically and abroad. This course examines the Japanese literature of three major periods in Japan's history, focusing on how
literary and performance traditions have been interrelated in the unfolding of Japanese literary history. We will begin by looking into the Heian period (794-1185),
72
when the work of female authors occupied center stage and some of the canonical texts of the Japanese literary and cultural tradition were born. Next we will
consider the medieval period (1185-1600), which saw the rise of the samurai class and the consequent shift in the domain of artistic creation. Then we will look at
the Edo period (1600-1867), when a new bourgeois culture flourished and audiences were greatly transformed. We will also explore the continuing force of
premodern literary traditions in contemporary performing arts. All readings and discussions will be in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, presentations, written journals, two essay questions, one paper, and attendance of live perfor-
mance events.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 15). Open to all.

ASTRONOMY (Div. III)
Chair, Professor KAREN B. KWITTER
Professors: KWITTER, J. PASACHOFF. Observatory Supervisor/Lecturer: SOUZA.
How long will the Sun shine? Are there planets like Earth among the many circling other stars? How did the universe begin and how has it evolved over its
13.7 billion-year history? Astronomy is the science that asks and tries to answer questions like these. We have come a long way toward understanding what makes
the sky appear as it does and how the Universe is fashioned. The Astronomy Department offers courses for anyone who is interested in learning about the Uni-
verse, and who would like to be able to follow new astronomical discoveries as they are made. All courses in Astronomy satisfy the Division III requirement. The
Astrophysics major, administered jointly with the Physics Department, and the Astronomy major, are described below.
The beginning astronomy courses are offered on two levels. Astronomy 101, 102, 104, and 330-range courses are intended primarily for non-science majors,
and have no prerequisite. Astronomy 111 is designed for students with some exposure to or interest in physics. It has a prerequisite of one year of high school
physics or permission of the instructor, and a corequisite of Mathematics 104 or equivalent background in calculus.
Most of the astronomy courses take advantage of our observational and computational facilities including a 24-inch computer-controlled telescope with sensi-
tive electronic detectors, and our own computer network for image processing and data analysis. The Astronomy Department homepage can be found at
http://www.williams.edu/Astronomy.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Astrophysics major is designed for students who want a rigorous introduction to the field, and includes not only those who plan graduate study in astrono-
my, astrophysics, or a closely related area, but also those interested in a wide variety of careers. Alumni are not only astronomers but also computer scientists,
geologists, teachers, doctors, lawyers, business school professors, and so on. In recent years, many astrophysics majors have had a second major in fields as wide
ranging as mathematics, geosciences, economics, and art history. This major emphasizes the description of the Universe and its constituents in terms of physical
processes. Potential Astrophysics majors should consult early with members of the Astronomy and Physics Departments to determine their most appropriate
route to and through the major. An essential ingredient in such students' undergraduate training is experience in physics and mathematics. Therefore, the major
normally will begin in the first year a student is at Williams with Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 104 or 105 or 106 in the fall. Students with very good
background placing them out of Physics 142 and out of Mathematics 104 may choose to take Physics 201 and Mathematics 105 or 106 instead. Astronomy 111
will often be taken in the fall of the sophomore year; however, many students take it in the fall of their first year at Williams, along with physics and math. Students
who might place out of physics courses should read the section on placement under Physics; those who place out of Physics 131 or 141 into Physics 142 or 151
should particularly consider taking Astronomy 111 in the fall of their first year.
In addition to the major courses described below, other courses in geosciences, mathematics, and computer science may also be appropriate.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS FOR ASTROPHYSICS
Astronomy 111 Introduction to Astrophysics
or Astronomy 101 Stars: From Suns to Black Holes
and either Astronomy 102 The Solar System--Our Planetary Home
or Astronomy 104 The Milky Way Galaxy and the Universe Beyond

The total number of courses required for the Astrophysics major, an interdisciplinary major, is eleven. Students entering with Advanced Placement in physics
and/or mathematics may obtain credit toward the major for the equivalent of Physics 141 and/or Mathematics 104 and/or 105 or 106 taken elsewhere, but at least
8 courses in astronomy, physics, and mathematics must be taken at Williams. There are some aspects of astrophysics that are closely related to chemistry or
geosciences. In recognition of this relation, certain advanced courses in those departments can be accepted for credit toward the Astrophysics major on a two-for-
one basis. It is not possible to double major in Astrophysics and Physics.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ASTROPHYSICS
The honors degree in Astrophysics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the results of an original observational, experimental, or
theoretical investigation carried out by the student under the direction of a faculty member in Astronomy or Physics. There are no specific grade require-
ments (other than College-wide requirements for remaining in good academic standing) for entry into the thesis research program; however, a student
wishing to do a thesis should have demonstrated both ability and motivation for independent work in previous courses and in any earlier research involve-
ment. Students doing theses will normally choose a topic and an advisor early in the second semester of their junior year and usually begin their thesis work
during the summer. During the senior year, those students whose proposals have been approved will elect two courses and a winter study project in addition
to the minimum requirements for the major. Preparation for the thesis will occupy at least one course (Astrophysics 493) and the winter study project
(Astrophysics 031). At the end of the winter study period, the departments will decide, in consultation with each student, whether to admit that student to
honors candidacy. Both a written thesis and an oral presentation to faculty and fellow students are required. The degree with honors will be awarded to those
who meet these requirements with distinction. The degree with highest honors will be awarded to those who fulfill the requirements with unusually high
distinction.
The departments will be flexible with regard to the number and timing of courses devoted to thesis research within the general guidelines of two courses and a
winter study project over and above the minimum major requirements and the written and oral presentations, especially in cases of students with advanced
standing and/or summer research experience. Students considering unusual requests are urged to consult with potential advisors or the department chairs as early
as possible.
ASTRONOMY MAJOR
The Astronomy major is designed for students with an interest in learning about many aspects of modern astronomy, but who do not choose to take the
advanced physics courses of the astrophysics major. It is also appropriate as a second major for students concentrating in another field. The Astronomy major
emphasizes understanding the observed properties of the physical systems that comprise the known Universe, from the Sun and solar system, to the evolution of
stars and star clusters, to the Milky Way Galaxy, to external galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Because some knowledge of physics and calculus is necessary to
understand many astronomical phenomena, the Astronomy major requires the first two semesters each of the physics and calculus that are also required of Phys-
ics majors and Astrophysics majors.
There are several possible routes through the Astronomy major, depending on preparation and interest. Students considering a major in Astronomy should
consult with members of the department early and often. A first-year student, unsure about choosing between Astronomy and Astrophysics, may wish to take not
only Astronomy 111 but also Physics 131, 141, or 151 and Mathematics 104 (if necessary) in the fall. Students who might place out of physics courses should
74
read the section on placement under Physics.

ASTRONOMY COURSES
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
ASTR 101(F) Stars: From Suns to Black Holes
What makes a star shine? For how long will the Sun keep shining? What are black holes and how can they form? Astronomy 101, a non-major, general introduc-
tion to the part of contemporary astronomy that includes how stars form and how they end their existence, will provide answers to these questions and more. The
course gives special attention to the exciting discoveries of the past few years. Topics include modern astronomical instruments such as the Hubble Space Tele-
scope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the new generation of 8- and 10-meter mountaintop telescopes, and results from them; how
astronomers interpret the light received from distant celestial objects; the Sun as a typical star (and how its future will affect ours); and our modern understanding
of how stars work and how they change with time. We will also discuss how pulsars and black holes result from the evolution of normal, massive stars and how
giant black holes are at the center of galaxies and quasars. We will discuss the discovery of planets around stars other than the Sun. We regularly discuss the latest
news briefs and developments in astronomy and relate them to the topics covered in the course. This course is independent of and on the same level as Astronomy
102 and 104, and students who have taken those courses are welcome.
Observing sessions will include use of the 24-inch telescope and other telescopes for observations of stars, star clusters, planets and their moons, nebulae, and
galaxies, as well as daytime observations of the Sun.
Format: lecture (three hours per week), observing sessions (scattered throughout the semester), afternoon labs (five times per semester), and a planetarium dem-
onstration. Evaluation will be based on two hour tests, a final exam, an observing portfolio, and laboratory reports.

ASTR 102(S) The Solar System--Our Planetary Home
What makes Earth different from all the other planets? Did Mars ever have running water? What is Pluto? Will asteroids or comets collide with the Earth? What is
a solar eclipse like? Astronomy 102, a non-major, general introduction to the part of contemporary astronomy that comprises the study of the solar system, will
provide answers to these questions and more. We will cover the historical development of humanity's understanding of the solar system, examining contributions
by Aristotle, Ptolemy, Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, and others. We will discuss the discovery of planets around stars other than the Sun. The course gives special
attention to exciting discoveries of the past few years by space probes and by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope. We regularly discuss
the latest news briefs and developments in astronomy and relate them to the topics covered in the course. This course is independent of, and on the same level as

ASTR 104 The Milky Way Galaxy and the Universe Beyond (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
It has been only about 85 years since the Sun was discovered not to be at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, and only 80 years since our Milky Way Galaxy was
determined to be only one of countless "island universes" in space. A host of technological advances is enabling us to understand even more clearly our place in
the universe and how the universe began. For example, the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory bring
clearer images and cover a wider range of the spectrum than has ever been obtainable before; they are speeding up progress on determining the past and future of
the Universe. They are confirming and enlarging our understanding of the Big Bang. In addition, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe spacecraft's study
of the early Universe and large-scale mapping programs are giving clues into how the Universe's currently observed structure arose. Astronomy 104, a non-ma-
jor, general introduction to part of contemporary astronomy comprising the study of galaxies and the Universe, explores the answers to questions like: What is the
Milky Way?; Why are quasars so luminous?; Is the Universe made largely of "dark matter" and "dark energy"?; What determines the ultimate fate of the Uni-
verse? We regularly discuss the latest news briefs and developments in astronomy and relate them to the topics covered in the course. This course is independent
of, and on the same level as Astronomy 101 and 102, and students who have taken those courses are welcome.
Observing sessions will include use of the 24-inch telescope and other telescopes for observations of stars, star clusters, planets and their moons, nebulae, and
galaxies, as well as daytime observations of the Sun.
Format: lectures (three hours per week), observing sessions (scattered throughout the semester), afternoon labs (five times per semester), and a planetarium
demonstration. Evaluation will be based on two hour tests, a final exam, an observing portfolio, and laboratory reports.
No prerequisites; not open to students who have taken or are taking Astronomy 330. Enrollment limit: 48 (expected: 48). Non-major course.
KWITTER (lectures) SOUZA (labs)
ASTR 330(S) The Nature of the Universe
A journey through space and time from the first 10-43 seconds to the ultimate fate of the Universe billions of years in the future. Topics include conditions during
the first three minutes, creation of the elements, stellar and giant black holes, the Big Bang and its remnant radiation, relativity, galaxies and quasars, the large scale
75
structure of the Universe, and current ideas about the future of the Universe and the end of time. In particular, we will explore the exciting new results on the
acceleration of the Universe's expansion, and the precise determination of its age and fate.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on two hour tests, a small observing portfolio, occasional homework, and a final exam.
No prerequisites; not open to students who have taken or are taking Astronomy 104; not open to Astronomy, Astrophysics, or Physics majors. Non-major course.

ASTR 332 A Guide to Black Holes and Other Exotic Astronomical Objects (Not offered 2009-2010)
What is a black hole? Are we inside a huge black hole? What are neutron stars and pulsars? The lives of different kinds of stars will be examined, with an
emphasis on scenarios of the late phases of stellar evolution. Starting with a general description of stars and their evolution and the physical processes taking place
in their centers, this course will discuss the final outcomes of stellar evolution: white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. We will discuss how neutron stars
were discovered and later led to the very important discovery of gravitational waves and extrasolar planets. Detailed discussion of the bizarre properties of black
holes will concentrate on relativistic effects, methods of observation and finally observational proofs of their existence. Recent astronomical observations with the
most powerful telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory, revealed that the Universe contains many more black holes
than previously expected and almost every galaxy harbors a super massive black hole at its center. Hypothetical but very interesting possibilities of time travel and
quantum effects connected with black holes will be covered. Students will have the opportunity to observe with our 24-inch telescope.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on classroom participation, homework assignments, a midterm exam and a final exam.
No prerequisites; not open to first-years and sophomores, or to Physics, Astronomy, or Astrophysics majors. Enrollment limit: 48 (expected: 48).
ASTR 336 Science, Pseudoscience, and the Two Cultures (Same as History of Science 336) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
A famous dichotomy between the sciences and the humanities, and public understanding of them, was laid down by C. P. Snow and has been widely discussed,
with ignorance of the second law of thermodynamics compared with ignorance of Shakespeare. In this seminar, we will consider several aspects of science and
scientific culture, including how scientific thinking challenges the claims of pseudoscience. We will consider C. P. Snow and his critics as well as the ideas about
the Copernican Revolution and other paradigms invented by Thomas Kuhn. We will discuss the recent "Science Wars" over the validity of scientific ideas. We
will consider the fundamental originators of modern science, including Tycho, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, viewing their original works in the Chapin Library of
rare books and comparing their interests in science with what we now call pseudoscience, like alchemy. We will review the history and psychology of astrology
and other pseudosciences. Building on the work of Martin Gardner in "Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science," and using the current journal "The Scientific
Review of Alternative Medicine," we consider from a scientific point of view what is now called complementary or alternative medicine, including both older
versions such as chiropractic and newer nonscientific practices. We consider such topics as GM (genetically modified) foods, the safety and regulation of dietary
supplements, and the validity of government and other recommendations relevant to the roles of dietary salt and fat in health. We consider the search for extrater-
restrial intelligence (SETI) and reports of UFO's and aliens. We consider the possible effects that superstitious beliefs have on the general public's cooperation in
vaccination programs and other consequences of superstition. We also consider the recently increased range of dramas that are based on scientific themes, such as
Tom Stoppard's Arcadia and Michael Frayn's Copenhagen.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on biweekly 5-page papers, participation in discussions, and a 15-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12).
Non-major course. Does not count toward the Astrophysics, Astronomy or Physics major.

ASTR 338 The Progress of Astronomy: Galileo through the Hubble Space Telescope (Same as History of Science 338 and Leadership Studies
338) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
Our capabilities of understanding the Universe have progressed over the 500 plus years since Copernicus moved the sun into the center. Galileo's breakthrough
observations of the sky with the new-fangled telescope led to hundreds of years of improving observations. In a seminar format, week by week, we will discuss
each of the following topics (and look at original first-editions in the Chapin Library): Copernicus and rare-book variations and annotations; Galileo and his
discoveries; mapping the sky and constellations 1540 to the present through star atlases; William and Caroline Herschel and the discovery of a new planet;
asteroids from 1 Ceres to 5100 Pasachoff and beyond, contemporary surveys, the extinction of the dinosaurs, and possible dangers to the Earth and its inhabitants;
astronomy teaching from when Williams College students first built its Hopkins Observatory through the Committee of Ten to the Journal of Astronomy Educa-
tion Research; planetariums from pasted stars to optomechnical and digital 21st-century projection; woman astronomers and astronauts and their reception and
roles; transits of Venus: from Horrocks and Capt. Cook through the 2004/2012 pair; the launch of Sputnik and the race to the Moon; the formation of NASA and
its transformation through space shuttles and the International Space Station; the past, present, and future of the Hubble Space Telescope; NASA's "Great Obser-
vatories," including not only Hubble but also the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope; NASA's "Vision" of sending astronauts to the
Moon and Mars; advances in ground-based observatories and telescopes; mapping the Universe through projects like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF; and
the discovery that the Universe's expansion is accelerating and its ramifications. We consider the role of individual leadership in the various topics.
Format: seminar, one three-hour meeting a week. Planetarium demonstration, with individual planetarium work on request. Evaluation will be based on two
10-page papers and participation in discussions.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to juniors and seniors and to those with backgrounds in science, history of science,
or philosophy. Non-major course. Does not count toward the Astrophysics, Astronomy, or Physics major.

ASTR 219T/419T Observational Cosmology (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
The past decade has seen the birth of "precision cosmology," based on combined results from Hubble Space Telescope key projects, cosmic microwave back-
ground satellites and ground-based surveys. According to the derived "concordance model" the universe is 13.7 billion years old and is currently expanding at a
rate of 72 km/sec/megaparsec. The model also describes a flat, accelerating big-bang universe that underwent very early inflation and is now dominated by dark
energy and cold dark matter. In this course students will explore the observations and interpretations that have led to our current understanding of the universe's
history and structure. Topics will include galaxy structure and evolution, the cosmic microwave background (e.g., Cosmic Background Observer and Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe) distant supernova searches (e.g., High-Z Supernova Team and Supernova Cosmology Project), galaxy surveys (e.g., Sloan Digital
Sky Survey and 2dF (two-degree field)) as well as theoretical and supercomputing efforts.
Students will read portions of current texts as well as some more detailed research papers. Astronomy 419T students will complete additional reading and present
papers covering more advanced topics.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on five 5-page papers; presentation, response and discussion in the tutorial session; and evidence of growth in under-
standing over the semester.
Prerequisites: Astronomy 111 and for 219T: Physics 142/151; for 419T: Physics 202. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 6).

ASTR 402 Between the Stars: The Interstellar Medium (Not offered 2009-2010) (Q)
The matter between the stars--the interstellar medium--manifests itself in many interesting and unexpected ways, and, as the detritus of stars, its properties and
behavior hold clues to the history and future evolution of both stars and the galaxies that contain them. Stars are accompanied by diffuse matter all through their
lifetimes, from their birthplaces in dense molecular clouds, to the stellar winds they eject with varying ferocity as they evolve, to their final fates as they shed their
outer layers, whether as planetary nebulae or dazzling supernovae. As these processes go on, they enrich the interstellar medium with the products of the stars'
nuclear fusion. The existence of life on Earth is eloquent evidence of this chemical enrichment.
In this course we will study the interstellar medium in its various forms. We will discuss many of the physical mechanisms that produce the radiation we observe
from diffuse matter, including radiative ionization and recombination, collisional excitation of "forbidden" lines, collisional ionization, and synchrotron radiation.
This course is observing-intensive. Throughout the semester students will work in small groups to design, carry out, analyze, and critique their own observations
of the interstellar medium using the equipment on our observing deck.
Format: seminar/discussion, plus computer work and observing projects. Evaluation will be based on homework, class presentations/problem-solving, and ob-
serving projects.
Prerequisite: Physics 201. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 8).

ASTR 408T The Solar Corona (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
The solar corona has recently been revealed as the connection between the Sun and the Earth. Observations from the 10 instruments on the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) now aloft are showing the flow of material from the Sun to the Earth in unprecedented detail. Further, data from total solar eclipses will be
used to study the cause of the heating of the solar corona and will be linked to space observations from SOHO, TRACE, and Yohkoh solar satellites. We discuss
theoretical aspects and observational techniques, and will make solar observations. Students will meet weekly with the professor in groups of two or three to
discuss readings, solve problems, present short papers, and/or make observations.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on the submitted material and on tutorial participation, as well as on a final paper.
Prerequisites: Astronomy 111 (or Astronomy 101 and either 102 or 104 with permission of instructor) and a 200-level Physics or Astronomy course. Enrollment
limit: 10.

ASTR 410 Compact Stellar Remnants: White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars and Black Holes (Not offered 2009-2010)
A star is a very interesting, very complicated physical object. Properties of stars and their evolutionary paths depend on an intricate interplay of different physical
phenomena with gravity, nuclear interactions, radiation processes and even quantum and relativistic effects playing important roles. Using basic physics we will
construct simple models of stars and discuss their evolution, concentrating on the key physical processes that play the dominant role at different evolutionary
stages. We will discuss late stages of stellar evolution and concentrate on the basic properties of three possible remnants: white dwarfs, neutron stars and black
holes. Radio and X-ray pulsars will be discussed as well as observational confirmation of existence of black holes. We will explore extreme conditions existing
near neutron stars and black holes and discuss their astrophysical consequences.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on classroom participation, homework assignments, a midterm exam and a final exam.
Prerequisite: Physics 201. Enrollment limit:19 (expected: 12).
ASTR 412T(S) Solar Physics (W)
We study all aspects of the Sun, our nearest star. We discuss the interior, including the neutrino experiment and helioseismology, the photosphere, the chromo-
sphere, the corona, and the solar wind. We discuss the Sun as an example of stars in general. We discuss both theoretical aspects and observational techniques,
including work at recent total solar eclipses. We discuss results from current spacecraft, including the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Tran-
sition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE). We also discuss data analysis of recent transits of Mercury across the face of the Sun and the June 8, 2004, transit
of Venus, the first transit of Venus since 1882.
Students will meet weekly with the professor in groups of two or three to discuss readings and present short papers.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on four 5-page papers, discussions, and presentations. Students will be expected to improve their writing throughout the
course, with the aid of careful editing by and comments from the professor.
Prerequisites: Astronomy 111 (or Astronomy 101 and either 102 or 104 with permission of instructor) and a 200-level Physics or Astronomy course. Enrollment
limit: 12 (expected: 10).

BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
(Div. III)
Chair, Professor ROBERT SAVAGE
Advisory Committee: Professors: DEWITT, KAPLAN, LOVETT**, D. LYNCH,RAYMOND, ROSEMAN, SAVAGE. Associate Professors: BAN-
TA, GEHRING***. Assistant Professors: HUTSON, TING.
Biochemistry and molecular biology are dynamic fields that lie at the forefront of science. Through elucidation of the structure and function of biologically
important molecules (such as nucleic acids, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates) these disciplines have provided important insights and advances in the fields of
molecular engineering (recombinant DNA technology, "intelligent" drug design, "in vitro evolution"), genomics and proteomics, signal transduction, immunolo-
gy, developmental biology, and evolution.
The Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program is designed to provide students with an opportunity to explore living systems in molecular terms. Bio-
chemistry and molecular biology are at the interface between the chemical and biological methods of looking at nature; therefore, the program draws heavily from
these disciplines. While chemistry is concerned with the relationship between molecular structure and reactions, and biology focuses on cells and organisms,
biochemistry and molecular biology probe the details of the structures and interactions of molecules in living systems in order to provide the foundation for a
better understanding of biological molecules both individually and as members of more complex structures.
PROGRAM
While aspects of biochemistry and molecular biology can be very diverse, a common set of chemical and biological principles underlie the more advanced
topics. With this in mind, the program has been structured to provide the necessary background in chemistry and biology and the opportunity to study the many
facets of the modern areas of the biochemical sciences. Students interested in the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program should plan their course selection
carefully. Since it is expected that Biochemistry 321 and 322 would be taken in the junior year, students are advised to take the prerequisites for those courses in
both chemistry and biology during their first two years at Williams. While the program is open to all students, it is expected that it will appeal primarily to majors
in biology and chemistry because of the number of courses required in those fields. In addition to taking the required courses, students planning to complete the
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program are strongly encouraged to elect courses in mathematics and physics.
The following interdepartmental courses serve as the core of the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program.
BIMO 321 and 322 provide a comprehensive introduction to biochemistry. BIMO 401, the capstone course for the concentration, provides students the oppor-
tunity to examine the current scientific literature in a wide variety of BIMO-related research areas.
BIMO 321(F) Biochemistry I--Structure and Function of Biological Molecules (Same as Biology 321 and Chemistry 321) (Q)
This course introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry with an emphasis on the structure and function of biological macromolecules. Specifically, the structure
of proteins and nucleic acids are examined in detail in order to determine how their chemical properties and their biological behavior result from those structures.
Other topics covered include enzyme kinetics, mechanism and catalysis and regulation; the molecular organization of biomembranes; and the flow of infor-
mation from nucleic acids to proteins. In addition, the principles and applications of the methods used to characterize macromolecules in solution and the interac-
tions between macromolecules are discussed.
The laboratory provides an opportunity to study the structure of macromolecules and to learn the fundamental experimental techniques of biochemistry including
electrophoresis, chromatography, and principles of enzymatic assays.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on quizzes, a midterm exam, a final exam, problem sets and
performance in the laboratories including lab reports.
Prerequisites: Biology 101 and Chemistry 251/255 and Chemistry 155/256. Enrollment limit: 32 (expected: 32). Preference given to junior and senior Biology
and Chemistry majors and BIMO concentrators.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-5 M,W KAPLAN
BIMO 322(S) Biochemistry II--Metabolism (Same as Biology 322 and Chemistry 322) (Q)
This lecture course provides an in-depth presentation of the complex metabolic reactions which are central to life. Emphasis is placed on the biological flow of
energy including alternative modes of energy generation (aerobic, anaerobic, photosynthetic); the regulation and integration of the metabolic pathways including
compartmentalization and the transport of metabolites; and biochemical reaction mechanisms including the structures and mechanisms of coenzymes. This com-
prehensive study also includes the biosynthesis and catabolism of small molecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides). Laboratory experiments
introduce the principles and procedures used to study enzymatic reactions, bioenergetics, and metabolic pathways.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on several exams and performance in the laboratories including
lab reports that emphasize conceptual and quantitative and/or graphic analysis of the data generated.
Prerequisites: Biology 101 and Chemistry 251/255. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 36). Preference given to junior and senior Biology and Chemistry majors and
BIMO concentrators.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T D. LYNCH
BIMO 401(S) Topics in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
This seminar course involves a critical reading, analysis, and discussion of papers from the current biochemistry and molecular biology literature. Specific topics
vary from year to year but are chosen to illustrate the importance of a wide range of both biological and chemical approaches to addressing important questions in
the biochemical and molecular biological fields.
Format: seminar, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class discussions and presentations, several short papers, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Biology 202 and BIMO 321. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8). Preference given to those completing the BIMO program; open to others with
permission of instructor.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR LOVETT
To complete the concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, a student must complete all of the required courses listed below, take one
elective not within the student's major from the list below, and attend at least eight Biology and/or Chemistry Department colloquia. Since the Chemis-
try Department counts two biology courses and the Biology Department counts two chemistry courses toward the majors (each of which can be com-
pleted with only eight other courses), a student majoring in either chemistry or biology would have to take only two or three additional courses to
complete the program.

Bioinformatics, genomics, and proteomics are rapidly advancing fields that integrate the tools and knowledge from biology, chemistry, computer science,
mathematics, physics, and statistics in research at the intersection of the biological and informational sciences. Inspired by the enormous amount of biological
data that are being generated from the sequencing of genomes, these new fields will help us pose and answer biological questions that have long been considered
too complex to address. Research in genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics will also significantly impact society affecting medicine, culture, economics, and
politics.
The Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics curriculum involves faculty from the biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics/statistics, and phys-
ics departments and was designed to provide students with an understanding of these revolutionary new areas of investigation. The introductory level courses,
Computation and biology and Statistics for Biologists are accessible to all students interested in gaining familiarity with the power of genomic analysis. Students
interested in graduate work in bioinformatics, genomics, and proteomics should take the core courses and five of the recommended courses. Interested students
are also encouraged to participate in independent research with members of the advisory faculty as they explore the development of these new fields.

ZOTTOLI. Associate Professors: BANTA, MORALES**. Senior Lecturer: D. C. SMITH. Assistant Professors: HUTSON, TING. Part-
time Visiting Assistant Professor: HIMES. Professor of Marine Science for the Williams-Mystic Program: CARLTON. Lecturer: MACINTIRE.
Instructor: DEAN.
The Biology curriculum has been designed to provide students with a broad base for understanding principles governing life processes at all levels, from
biochemistry and cell biology to physiology to ecology and behavior. Courses emphasize fundamentals common to all subdisciplines including the coupling of
structure to function, the transfer of energy in living systems, communication, and the molding of diversity by the evolutionary process. In upper-level courses and
in independent and honors research, students have the opportunity to investigate areas at the frontiers of modern biology.
Although the Biology major is specifically designed to provide a balanced curriculum in the broader context of the liberal arts, it is also excellent preparation
for graduate studies in the life sciences and in the health professions.
MAJOR REQUIREMENTS
In order to make the major accessible to students with diverse interests, required courses are kept to a minimum. The Biology major is satisfied by nine courses,
as follows:
Biology 101 The Cell
Biology 102 The Organism
Biology 202 Genetics
Any two 300-level courses, each of which must have a laboratory associated with it.
Any one 400-level course other than 493-494.
Any other three courses or any other two courses and two semesters of Organic Chemistry.
NOTE: Independent study courses and AMS 311 (Same as Biology 231) do not fulfill the 300-level or 400-level course requirements. WIOX 216,
Biology: Evolution, in the Williams Oxford Program qualifies for major credit.
Distribution Requirement
In order to ensure that majors broaden their knowledge of biology, one of the elective courses for the major must include an upper-level course covering
biological processes at levels of organization above the cell. Courses that satisfy this distribution requirement are indicated in the individual course description.
COURSE SELECTION AND PLACEMENT
It is preferable for students who plan to major in biology, or think they may be interested in doing so, to take Biology 101, 102 during their first year at
Williams. It is also possible to begin the Biology major during the sophomore year, although students should understand that it may require taking two or more
biology courses during several semesters.
Students interested in biology, whether or not they intend to major in it, are encouraged to take Biology 101, 102. It is also possible, with permission of the
instructor, to take Biology 203 Ecology, Biology 204 Animal Behavior, Biology 220 Field Botany and Biology 225 Natural History of the Berkshires without
prerequisite. Other 100-level biology courses are designed specifically for students who do not intend to take additional upper-level courses in biology. All of
these courses satisfy the Division III distribution requirement.
Beginning students should normally enroll in Biology 101 and 102. Students with unusually strong backgrounds in biology, such as those with outstanding
performance on the College Board Biology Advanced Placement Test, may be permitted to elect a sophomore-level course in lieu of Biology 101 and/or Biology
102 upon successful completion of a departmental qualifying exam, administered during First Days.
COURSES RELATED TO THE BIOLOGY MAJOR
Students planning to pursue their interest in biology and related fields after completing their undergraduate degrees are strongly encouraged to take one year of
chemistry, at least one semester of mathematics (a course in statistics is recommended), and one semester of physics. Students may wish to check the require-
ments for graduate admission at relevant universities, and are also encouraged to consult with the Biology Department's graduate school advisor about prerequi-
sites for admission to graduate programs.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (BIMO) should consult the general statement under Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.
BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS AND PROTEOMICS
Students interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics and Proteomics (BiGP) should consult the general statement under Bioinformatics, Genomics and Proteom-
ics. Biology majors interested in this field are strongly encouraged to enroll in Integrative Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics (Biology 319).
NEUROSCIENCE
Students interested in Neuroscience (NSCI) should consult the general statement under Neuroscience.
ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
Students interested in Environmental Studies (ENVI) should consult the general statement under Environmental Studies.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN BIOLOGY
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a Biology major is normally expected to have completed the equivalent of two semesters and a winter
study (031) of independent research culminating in a thesis which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. Although the
presentation of a thesis and associated oral presentation in the fall and poster defense in the spring are required for consideration for a degree with honors, their
completion should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. The principal considerations in admitting a student to the program of independent
honors research will be mastery of fundamental material and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and demonstrated interest and motivation.
Students interested in participating in the honors program should consult with the department early in the spring semester of the junior year; approval must be
received before spring registration in the junior year. The number of Biology Department faculty available to mentor research students and the number of students
each can accommodate in her/his lab vary from year to year. Although the department will make every effort to provide an opportunity for students to conduct
Honors research, you should be aware that it may not be possible to assign all applicants to a laboratory.
The minimum course requirements for a degree with honors in Biology are Biology 101, Biology 102, Biology 202, two 300-level biology courses (each of
which must have a laboratory associated with it), one 400-level biology course, Biology 493, Biology 494, WSP 031, and any other two courses in biology (or
any other one course and two semesters of Organic Chemistry). Note: A student who has a double major cannot count any course twice. For example, if a student
is a Biology and Chemistry major, Organic Chemistry can only be counted in one of the two majors.
In addition to the normal honors route, which includes two semesters (Biology 493-494) and a winter study of research (WSP 031) during senior year, students
have the option, subject to the approval of their thesis advisor, to begin the honors research during winter study junior year or during the second semester junior
year. In general, thesis students who start during WSP or spring semester of their junior year are working on a project that requires winter or spring field work.
Students beginning honors in winter study of junior year would take Biology 494 in the spring of their junior year followed by Biology 493 in the fall of their
senior year; students beginning honors during the second semester of junior year would take Biology 494 that semester, followed by Biology 493 in the fall of
senior year and winter study research in the winter of the senior year.
STUDY ABROAD
Students planning on majoring in Biology are strongly advised to take Biology 202 before going abroad, since Biology 202 is required for the major and a
prerequisite for many upper-level courses; a Genetics course taken while studying away cannot substitute for Biology 202. Biology majors studying abroad may
receive credit toward the major for at most two 200-level electives; the departmental distribution requirement can be satisfied through an appropriate course taken
during study abroad. Students should meet with the Department Chair to discuss study abroad options.
CREDIT FOR COURSES AT OTHER INSTITUTIONS
Students who enroll in study away programs may receive credit for up to two 200-level electives towards the biology major upon approval of the course syllabi
by the Biology Department Chair.
Students wishing to satisfy prerequisites for courses offered by the Biology Department with courses taken at other institutions should consult, in person, with a
member of the Biology Department, prior to registering for the course that requires a prerequisite. Such consultations will include a review of the course syllabi
and the transcripts of the relevant previous college work, and students should bring these materials with them.
BIOL 101(F) The Cell

BIOL 134(S) The Tropics: Biology and Social Issues (Same as Environmental Studies 134) (D)
Intended for the non-scientist, this course explores the biological dimensions of social issues in tropical societies, and focuses specifically on the peoples and
cultures of tropical regions in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceanea, and the Caribbean. Tropical issues have become prominent on a global scale, and many
social issues in the tropics are inextricably bound to human ecology, evolution, and physiology. The course begins with a survey of the tropical environment of
humans, including major climatic and habitat features. The next section focuses on human population biology, and emphasizes demography and the role of
disease particularly malaria and AIDS. The final part of the course covers the place of human societies in local and global ecosystems including the challenges of
tropical food production, the importance of organic diversity, and the interaction of humans with their supporting ecological environment.
Format: lecture/debate, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on two hour exams, a short paper, panel preparation, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 60 (expected: 60). Preference given to seniors, juniors, sophomores, and first-year students-- in that order. Does not count for
major credit in Biology.
This course fulfills the EDI requirement. Through lectures, debates and readings, students confront social issues in the tropics from the perspective of biologist.
This builds a framework for life long exploration of human diversity.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF J. EDWARDS

BIOL 204 Animal Behavior (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Making sense of what we see while watching animals closely is both an enthralling pastime and a discipline that draws on many aspects of biology. Explanations
can be found on many levels: evolutionary theory tells us why certain patterns have come to exist, molecular biology can help us understand how those patterns
are implemented, neuroscience gives insights as to how the world appears to the behaving animal, endocrinology provides information on how suites of behav-
iors are regulated. The first part of the course focuses upon how descriptive studies provide the basis for formulating questions about behavior as well as the
statistical methods used to evaluate the answers to these questions. We then consider the behavior of individuals, both as it is mediated by biological mechanisms
and as it appears from an evolutionary perspective. The second half of the course is primarily concerned with the behaviors of groups of animals from a wide
variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species, concentrating upon the stimuli, responses, and internal mechanisms that maintain social systems and on the selec-
tion pressures that drive animals toward a particular social system.
Format: lecture/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on examinations, lab reports, and a research paper.
Prerequisites: Biology 102, or Psychology 101, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 32 (expected: 32). Preference given to seniors, Biology majors, and

BIOL 210T Evo-Devo: The Evolution of Animal Design (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
What makes a bird a bird and a frog a frog? The key to understanding the mechanisms that generate biological form and diversity lies in a new and rapidly
growing field, termed "evo-devo," that represents a synthesis of evolution and development. This course, designed specifically for sophomores, aims to explore
evo-devo in detail by building on material introduced in Biology 102. Using readings from the primary literature, the course will consider topics such as how the
modification of developmental mechanisms can create novel traits, why some traits are resistant to change, how the determination of shared ancestral traits differs
from those that rise independently, and how ecological considerations impact development to modulate evolutionary change.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: after an initial group meeting, students meet weekly with a tutorial partner and the instructor for an hour each week. Each student
will write and present orally a 5-page paper every other week on the readings assigned for that week. In alternate weeks the students will question and critique the
work of their colleague. Evaluation will be based on five 5-page papers, tutorial presentations, and the student's effectiveness as a critic.

BIOL 308(S) Integrative Plant Biology: Fundamentals and New Frontiers
Plants are one of the most successful groups of organisms on Earth and have a profound impact on all life. Successful use of plants in addressing global problems
and understanding their role in natural ecosystems depends on fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which they grow, develop, and respond
to their environment. This course will examine the molecular physiology of plants using an integrative approach that considers plants as dynamic, functional units
in their environment. Major emphasis will be on understanding fundamental plant processes, such as photosynthesis, growth and development, water transport,
hormone physiology, and flowering, from the molecular to the organismal level. Environmental effects on these processes will be addressed in topics including
photomorphogenesis, stress physiology, mineral nutrition, and plant-microbe interactions. Discussions of original research papers will examine the mechanisms
plants use to perform these processes and explore advances in the genetic engineering of plants for agricultural, environmental, and medical purposes. Laboratory
activities stress modern approaches and techniques used in investigating plant physiological processes.
Format: lecture/discussion/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on lab reports, a term paper, and exams.

Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR Lab: 1-4 W,R TING
BIOL 310(F) Neural Development and Plasticity (Same as Neuroscience 310)
Development can be seen as a tradeoff between genetically-determined processes and environmental stimuli. The tension between these two inputs is particularly
apparent in the developing nervous system, where many events must be predetermined, and where plasticity, or altered outcomes in response to environmental
conditions, is also essential. Plasticity is reduced as development and differentiation proceed, and the potential for regeneration after injury or disease in adults is
limited; however, some exceptions to this rule exist, and recent data suggest that the nervous system is not as hard-wired as previously thought. In this course we
will discuss the mechanisms governing nervous system development, from relatively simple nervous systems such as that of the roundworm, to the more compli-
cated nervous systems of humans, examining the roles played by genetically specified programs and non-genetic influences.
Format: lecture/discussion/laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on exams, class participation and lab reports.
Prerequisites: Biology212/Neuroscience 201. Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 12). Preference given to Biology majors and Neuroscience concentrators.

they evolve to fill specific ecological niches, with an emphasis on microbe:host interactions that lead to pathogenesis. We will consider communication among
bacteria as well as between bacteria and their environment. Topics include: microbial development, population dynamics, bioremediation, plant and animal de-
fenses against infection, and bacterial strategies to subvert the immune system. In the lab, major projects will focus on horizontal gene transfer, metagenomics,
and the isolation and characterization of bacteria from natural environments. Students will also use flow cytometry to investigate fundamental aspects of the
mammalian immune system. The lab experience will culminate in multi-week independent investigations. Readings will be supplemented by articles from the
primary literature.
Format: lectures, three hours a week; laboratory, three hours a week. Evaluation will be based on three exams, a lab report, and a poster presentation or term
paper.

BIOL 319(F) Integrative Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics Lab (Same as Chemistry 319, Computer Science 319, Mathematics 319
and Physics 319) (Q)
What can computational biology teach us about cancer? In this capstone experience for the Genomics, Proteomics, and Bioinformatics program, computational
analysis and wet-lab investigations will inform each other, as students majoring in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics/statistics, and physics
contribute their own expertise to explore how ever-growing gene and protein data-sets can provide key insights into human disease. In this course, we will take
advantage of one well-studied system, the highly conserved Ras-related family of proteins, which play a central role in numerous fundamental processes within
the cell. The course will integrate bioinformatics and molecular biology, using database searching, alignments and pattern matching, and recombinant DNA
techniques to reconstruct the evolution of the RAS gene family by focusing on the gene duplication events and gene rearrangements that have occurred over the
course of eukaryotic speciation. By utilizing high through-put approaches to investigate genes involved in various signal transduction pathways, students will
identify pathways that are aberrantly activated in mammalian cell lines carrying a mutant, constantly active Ras protein. This functional genomic strategy will be
coupled with microscopic examination of tissue sections from a variety of human colon tumors, using phosphorylation-state specific antisera, to test our hypothe-
ses. Proteomic analysis will introduce the students to de novo structural prediction and threading algorithms, as well as data-mining approaches to identify specif-
ic amino acids involved in protein-protein contacts. Flow cytometry and mass spectrometry will be used to study networks of interacting proteins in normal colon
and colon tumor tissue.

BIOL 410(S) Cell Dynamics in Living Systems (Same as Neuroscience 341)
Far from being static entities, individual cells can exhibit dynamic behaviors, sometimes migrating great distances or structurally reorganizing as in the forma-
tion--or reformation--of neuronal synapses. The ability of cells to move and reshape underlies a vast array of normal biological processes, including immune
function, embryonic development, and memory formation, as well as abnormal processes such as cancer growth and metastasis. It is through precise regulation of
cytoskeletal dynamics that much of cellular motility is achieved, and we are just beginning to understand the detailed mechanisms of how this is regulated. In this
course we will examine the theory and mechanisms of bacterial chemotaxis, the remarkable life cycle of the soildwelling amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum,
and how migration and motility are regulated in a variety of eukaryotic systems.

BIOL 413(S) Molecular Basis of Biological Clocks
Circadian rhythms have been described in all organisms studied, including humans, a wide range of other eukaryotes and several prokaryotes. With periods of
about 24 hours, these rhythms regulate biochemical, cellular, physiological and behavioral activities. Circadian rhythms are generated by cellular clocks--geneti-
cally determined internal pacemakers that maintain their oscillations in the absence of environmental cues but may be reset by periodicities in the environment,
especially the light-dark cycle. Only recently have we begun to understand how circadian rhythms are generated and controlled at the cellular level. This course
will explore the basic biochemical features of biological clocks with the aim of understanding their crucial role in regulating key biological parameters, such as
enzyme levels, levels of hormones and other regulatory molecules, and activity and sleep cycles. Class discussions will focus on readings in the original literature.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several short papers.
Prerequisites: Biology 202. Enrollment limit: 2 sections of 12 per section (expected: 12 ). Open to juniors and seniors, with preference given to senior Biology
majors who have not taken a 400-level course.

BIOL 414(F) Life at Extremes: Molecular Mechanisms
All organisms face variability in their environments, and the molecular and cellular responses to stresses induced by environmental change often illuminate
otherwise hidden facets of normal physiology. Moreover, many organisms have evolved unique molecular mechanisms, such as novel cellular compounds or
85
macromolecular structural modifications, which contribute to their ability to survive continuous exposure to extreme conditions, such as high temperatures or low
pH. This course will examine how chaperonins, proteases, and heat- and cold-shock proteins are regulated in response to changes in the external environment. We
will then consider how these and other molecular mechanisms function to stabilize DNA and proteins -and, ultimately, cells and organisms. Other extreme envi-
ronments, such as hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, snow fields, hypersaline lakes, the intertidal zone, and acid springs provide further examples of cellular
and molecular responses to extreme conditions. Biotechnological applications of these molecular mechanisms in areas such as protein engineering will also be
considered. Class discussions will focus on readings from the primary literature.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several short papers.
Prerequisites: Biology 202. Enrollment limit: 2 sections of 12 per section (expected: 12 per section). Open to juniors and seniors, with preference given to senior
Biology majors who have not taken a 400-level course.

BIOL 415(F) Developmental and Genomic Evolution of Animal Design
The basis of what makes a bird a bird and a frog a frog has less to do with a specific complement of genes but rather the way in which genes are differentially
expressed in a given lineage. Most new design features result from changes in gene expression and function that have been incorporated into the genome and
subsequently translated into form by developmental processes. Therefore the key to understanding the mechanisms that generate biological form and diversity lie
at the intersection of a rapidly growing fields of evolutionary, developmental and genome biology. This course will explore how the modification of developmen-
tal mechanisms can create novel traits, how others are resistant to change, the basis of shared ancestral traits as opposed to those that arise independently. Class
discussions will focus on readings from the original literature.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several short papers.
Prerequisites: Biology 202; open to juniors and seniors. Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 20). Preference given to senior Biology majors who have not taken a
400-level course.

BIOL 416 Epigenetics (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
After decades of studies emphasizing the role of DNA in heredity, scientists are now turning their attention from genetics to a variety of heritable phenomena that
fall under the heading of epigenetics, heritable changes that do not result from an alteration in DNA sequence. Research reveals that stable changes in cell function
can result from, for example, stable changes in protein conformation, protein modification, DNA methylation, or the location of a molecule within the cell. Using
readings from the primary literature, we will explore the epigenetic nature and molecular mechanisms underlying a diverse array of phenomena such as prion
propagation, genetic imprinting, dosage compensation, transvection, centromere formation, synapse function, and programmed genome rearrangements. The
significance of epigenetic processes for development, evolution, and human health will be discussed.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several short papers.
Prerequisites: Biology 202. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Open to sophomores, juniors and seniors, with preference given to senior Biology majors who
have not taken a 400-level course, then to juniors.

BIOL 418 The Biology of Aging (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Aging is a fundamental biological process that is driven by highly conserved pathways involved in metabolism and reproduction. Yet, there is enormous diversity
in how long different organisms live, and in the details of the mechanisms involved. There is also much debate as to whether aging is the result of stochastic
events, or rather a genetically programmed inevitability. Our understanding of how and why we age, at the cellular and molecular levels, has reached a point that
therapeutic interventions to aging are being explored. In this discussionbased course, we will examine models and mechanisms that are involved in the process
of aging including calorie restriction, genetic damage, oxidative damage, metabolic pathways, and the role of telomerase. We will also examine the interconnec-
tions between aging and disease, stem cell research, and cancer. Studentled discussions will focus on readings in the original literature.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several short papers.
Prerequisites: Biology 202. Enrollment limit: 2 sections of 12 per section (expected: 12/section). Open to juniors and seniors, with preference given to senior
Biology majors who have not taken a 400level course.

BIOL 420 Evolutionary Genetics (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Recent advances in genetics and genomics provide unparalleled tools for the study of evolution. This course will begin by examining the structure and organiza-
tion of genes and genomes (why do all organisms have DNA anyway? where do sex chromosomes come from? why do genomes vary wildly in size among
organisms?), and then expand our focus to encompass organismal and population-level processes (adaptation, speciation, population structure, etc . Ultimately
we will turn the lens on ourselves to explore the ongoing evolution of Homo sapiens. Class discussions will focus on readings from current primary literature.
Format: discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussions and several short papers.
Prerequisite: Biology 202 and Biology 305, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12.

BIOL 424T Conservation Biology (Same as Environmental Studies 424T) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
This tutorial examines the application of population genetics, population ecology, community ecology, and systematics to the conservation of biological diversity.
While the focus of this tutorial is on biological rather than social, legal, or political issues underlying conservation decisions, the context is to develop science-
based recommendations that can inform policy. Topics include extinction, the genetics of small populations, habitat fragmentation, the impact of invasive species,
and conservation strategies.
Format: tutorial meeting each week between instructor and 2-3 students. Evaluation will be based on 5 (4-5-page) papers, tutorial presentations, and the student's
effectiveness as a critic.
Prerequisites: Biology 203 or 302 or 305 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Open to juniors and seniors, with preference given to
senior Biology majors who have not taken a 400-level course.

BIOL 425T Coevolution (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
Coevolution, defined as reciprocal adaptation between species, is central to understanding biological phenomena ranging from global patterns of biodiversity to
the molecular mechanisms of host-parasite evolution. The focus of this tutorial will be on coevolution as a paradigm for integrating across scales of biological
organization. Topics will include adaptive radiation, evolutionary dynamics and conservation, molecular coevolution of human disease (e.g., HIV) and evolution
of sex mediated by a sperm-egg arms-race.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on five (4-5 page) papers, tutorial presentations, and the student's effectiveness as a critic.
Prerequisites: Biology 203 or 302 or 305 or Environmental Studies 203 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Open to juniors and
seniors, with preference given to senior Biology majors who have not taken a 400-level course.

BIOL 426T(S) Frontiers in Muscle Physiology: Controversies (W)
While an active muscle produces force, contraction of muscle is far from the only function of this intriguing organ system. Muscle plays a major role in metabolic
regulation of organisms, acts as a glucose storage facility, regulates blood pressure in mammals, and produces numerous hormones. The mechanism for contrac-
tile activity varies not only among different organisms, but also among different muscles within the same organism. Controversies, disagreements, and arguments
pervade the muscle biology literature perhaps because of the integrative nature of the science. In this tutorial course, we will utilize molecular, physiological,
comparative, and evolutionary aspects of muscle biology to address current controversies of this dynamic tissue. Some questions that will be addressed include:
1) Lactic acid generated by skeletal muscle is / is not involved with fatigue at high exercise intensity, 2) Satellite cells are / are not obligatory for skeletal muscle
hypertrophy, 3) Do mammals possess the same "stretch activation" of skeletal muscle as seen in insect flight muscle?, 4) Are smooth and skeletal muscles from
the same lineage of cells, or do they represent convergent evolution on the tissue level? After an initial group meeting, students meet weekly with a tutorial partner
and the instructor for an hour each week. Every other week at this tutorial meeting, students present a written and oral critical analysis of the assigned research
articles. Students not making a presentation question and critique the work of their colleague.
Format: tutorial meeting one hour a week. Evaluation is based on five tutorial papers of four pages each, five critiques, tutorial presentations, and general partici-
pation.
Prerequisite: Biology 205. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected:10). Preference will be given to biology majors who have not had a 400-level biology course.
Tutorial meetings to be arranged. SWOAP
BIOL 428T(S) Evolutionary Ecology (W)
We all recognize the tight link between ecology and evolution. Excellent work on Evolutionary Ecology has deep roots (Darwin's work still provides some of the
best examples), but this area of research is particularly exciting now. New methods in DNA sequencing and in isotope analysis, combined with more flexible and
86
powerful ways to confront theory with data, are allowing us to integrate evolution and ecology more incisively than before. The aim of this tutorial is to explore
the surge of current research on the interface of ecology and evolution. The course starts with an analysis of levels of selection, then explores the effect of evolu-
tion on the dynamics of simple population interactions (mutualisms, predator-prey dynamics, and host-parasite conflicts), moves on to the origins of diversity
(sexual selection and speciation, ecological speciation), and finally to the assembly and control of complex communities (random community models, adaptive
radiations, and the assembly of diversity through geologic time). We cover each of these topics through an in-depth analysis of ten case studies of ecological
systems where evolutionary mechanisms play a critical role.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on five (4-5 page) papers, tutorial presentations, and the student's effectiveness as a critic.
Prerequisites: Biology 203 or 302 or 305 or Environmental Studies 203 or permission of instructor; open to juniors and seniors. Enrollment limit: 10 (ex-
pected:10). Preference given to senior biology majors who have not taken a 400 level course.

MAJOR
Through a variety of individual courses and sequential programs, the department provides an opportunity for students to explore the nature and significance of
chemistry, an area of important achievement in our quest for knowledge about ourselves and the world around us. The student of chemistry is able to become
aware of the special viewpoint of chemists, the general nature of chemical investigation, some of its important results, how these results are expressed, and
something of their significance within the fields of science and in the area of human endeavor as a whole. The Chemistry major provides excellent preparation for
graduate study in chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, environmental science, materials science, medicine, and the medical sciences.
A major in chemistry can be achieved in several ways, preferably beginning in the student's first year at Williams, but also beginning in the sophomore year.
Building on a foundation in general chemistry, organic chemistry, and physical chemistry, a student elects additional advanced courses to complete a major that is
consistent with his or her background in other sciences, interests, and goals. A student's program might emphasize biochemistry, organic chemistry, physical
chemistry, or inorganic chemistry, with additional courses available in analytical chemistry, environmental science, and materials science. Students considering a
major in chemistry should consult with a member of the department as early as possible in order to plan a program which best suits their interests and abilities and
which makes full use of their previous preparation.
All students begin their study in the department with either Chemistry 151, 153, or 155. Placement at the introductory level is based upon performance on the
departmental placement test results and consultation with the chair; results of the College Board Advanced Placement Test or the International Baccalaureate
Exam are also taken into account. The first year is completed with Chemistry 156. In the second year at the introductory level, students take Chemistry 251 (or
255) and Chemistry 256 (those students who complete 155 are exempted from 256). Completion of a Chemistry major requires either nine semester chemistry
courses or eight semester chemistry courses plus two approved courses from among the following: Biology 101; Computer Science 134; Mathematics 103, 104,
105, 106; Physics 131, 141; or any courses in these departments for which the approved courses are prerequisites. Starting at the 300 level, at least three of the
courses taken must have a laboratory component, and at least one must be selected from Chemistry 361, 366, 364, or 367. (The specific course elected, in con-
sultation with the chair or major advisor, will depend on the student's future plans.) In addition, the department has a number of "Independent Research Courses"
which, while they do not count toward completion of the major, provide a unique opportunity to pursue an independent research project under the direction of a
faculty member.

For the purpose of assisting students in selecting a program consistent with their interests and possible continuation of their studies at the gradu-
ate level, the following groupings of electives and faculty advisors are suggested. However, a case can be made for selecting courses from the
different groups.
Biochemistry: Chemistry 321, Chemistry 322, Chemistry 324, Chemistry 341, Chemistry 364, Chemistry 367. Students interested in biochemistry
should consult with Professors Gehring, Kaplan, or Lovett.
Organic Chemistry: Chemistry 341, Chemistry 342, Chemistry 343, Chemistry 344, Chemistry 364, Chemistry 361, Chemistry 366. Students interested
in organic chemistry should consult with Professors S. Goh, Oyelaran, Richardson, or Smith.
Physical and Inorganic Chemistry: Chemistry 335, Chemistry 336, Chemistry 361, Chemistry 364, Chemistry 366, Chemistry 368T. Students interested
in physical chemistry should consult with Professors Bingemann, Peacock-Lpez, or Thoman. Students interested in inorganic chemistry should consult
with Professor C. Goh or Park. Students interested in materials science should consult with Professors C. Goh or Park.
While any accepted route through the major would permit a student to proceed to graduate study in chemistry, four electives should be consid-
ered a minimum, and at least a semester of research is strongly recommended.
The department is accredited by the American Chemical Society (A.C.S.), a professional body of academic, industrial, and research chemists.
The A.C.S. suggests the following courses for someone considering graduate study or work in chemistry or a related area: 151 (153 or 155),
156, 251 (255), 256, 335, 361, 364, 366, 493-494; and at least two courses from 321, 322, 342, 344, 368T, BIMO 401. Students completing
these courses are designated Certified A.C.S. Majors.
BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (BIMO)
Students interested in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology should consult with the general statement under the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Program
(BIMO) in the Courses of Instruction. Students interested in completing the BIMO program are also encouraged to complete the biochemistry courses within the
chemistry major by taking 321, 322, 324, and 367 in addition to the first and second year required courses.
BIOINFORMATICS, GENOMICS, AND PROTEOMICS (BiGP)
Students interested in Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics should consult the general statement under Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Proteomics in the
Courses of Instruction. Students interested in these areas are also encouraged to complete the biochemistry courses within the chemistry major by taking 319, 321,
322, 324 and 367 in addition to the first and second year required courses.
MATERIALS SCIENCE
Students interested in Materials Science are encouraged to elect courses from the Materials Science program offered jointly with the Physics Department, and
should consult that listing.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CHEMISTRY
The degree with honors in Chemistry provides students with an opportunity to undertake an independent research project under the supervision of a faculty
member, and to report on the nature of the work in two short oral presentations and in a written thesis.
88
Chemistry majors who are candidates for the degree with honors take the following in addition to a major outlined above:
Chemistry 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis
The principal considerations in admitting a student to a program of independent research are mastery of fundamental materials and skills, ability to pursue
independent study successfully, and demonstrated student interest and motivation. In addition, to enroll in these courses leading to a degree with honors, a student
must have at least a B- average in all chemistry courses or the permission of the chair. At the end of the first semester of the senior year, the department reviews the
student's progress and determines whether the student is a candidate for a degree with honors. The designation of a degree with honors in Chemistry or a degree
with highest honors in Chemistry is based primarily on a departmental evaluation of the accomplishments in these courses and on the quality of the thesis.
Completion of the research project in a satisfactory manner and preparation of a well-written thesis usually results in a degree with honors. In cases where a
student has demonstrated unusual commitment and initiative resulting in an outstanding thesis based on original results, combined with a strong record in all of
his or her chemistry courses, the department may elect to award a degree with highest honors in Chemistry.
EXCHANGE AND TRANSFER STUDENTS
Students from other institutions wishing to register for courses in chemistry involving college-level prerequisites should do so in person with a member of the
Chemistry Department. Registration should take place by appointment during the spring semester prior to the academic year in which courses are to be taken.
Students are requested to have with them transcripts of the relevant previous college work.
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
Students with principal interests outside of the sciences may extend a secondary school foundation in chemistry by electing a basic two-semester introductory
course of a general nature or they may elect semester courses designed for non-majors. All courses in chemistry satisfy the divisional distribution requirement.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who wish to complete a chemistry major (or chemistry requirements for pre-medical study) as well as to study abroad during their junior
year are encouraged to begin taking chemistry in their first semester at Williams, and should consult with members of the department as early as pos-
sible.
COURSES FOR NON-MAJORS WITH NO PREREQUISITES
CHEM 111 Fighting Disease: The Evolution and Operation of Human Medicines (Not offered 2009-2010)
The past decade has seen an explosion in the number of pharmaceuticals available to doctors and their patients. Pills are now available to treat conditions as varied
as depression and baldness, and a cure for the common cold is in development. A visit to the doctor now seems incomplete without a prescription. Changes in
Food and Drug Administration and health insurance policies combined with the tremendous increase in advertisement of prescription drugs have also placed a
larger burden on consumers in deciding which drugs to take, as well as in paying for the medication.
This course focuses on understanding, at a biochemical level, how several drugs work their curative magic as well as how they may lead to undesired side effects.
We examine the processes through which drugs are discovered or created and how they are then brought to consumers. Topics range from the discovery of aspirin
and the effect of World War II on the discovery of cheap treatments for malaria to advances in protease inhibitors and combination therapies which have dramati-
cally extended the lives of AIDS patients. The main focus of the course is basic concepts in medicinal chemistry and biology which underlie the action of any
drug. We also explore the connections between basic research, biotechnology companies, multinational pharmaceutical firms, patent attorneys, regulatory agen-
cies, doctors, and insurers which eventually lead to the availability of a given drug.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural sciences. Principles in organic chemistry and biochemistry
will be developed as needed.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, class participation, a midterm, a final project, and a final exam.
No prerequisites, but high school-level preparation in biology or chemistry is recommended. Students who have not taken any high school biology or chemistry
courses should contact the instructor before enrolling. Students who have taken Chemistry 156 are not eligible. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 30).
CHEM 112(S) Chemistry of Tropical Diseases: Charting the Course from Traditional to Modern Medicines
Hundreds of millions of people, about one-sixth of the world's population, are still affected by infectious parasitic diseases that are also referred to as tropical or
orphan diseases, including malaria, sleeping sickness, tuberculosis, Chagas' disease, and leishmaniasis. Globally, a significant amount of effort and resources are
being devoted to innovative drug and vaccine research. However, progress in combating tropical diseases has been relatively slow.
We focus on understanding the medicinal chemistry and biology of tropical diseases and provides a survey of drugs that are being used to treat these diseases,
including traditional medicines, chemically defined natural products, natural product-derived drugs, and other synthetic small molecules. Oftentimes, one drug is
used to treat seemingly disparate diseases. We will look at how and why this practice is embraced. Topics will also include fundamental challenges faced in basic
research; a brief history of epidemics; the influence of economic policies and technology on drug discovery and development; and ways in which the scientific
and business communities as well as nonprofit and governmental agencies are responding to these unique challenges.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural sciences. Principles in organic chemistry, medicinal
chemistry, and biochemistry will be developed as needed.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, class participation, hour exams, and a final project.
No prerequisites, but students who have not taken any high school biology or chemistry courses must have permission of the instructor before enrolling; not open
to students who have taken Chemistry 156. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to non-science majors. Students will not receive credit for both
Chemistry 111 and Chemistry 112.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF OYELARAN
CHEM 113 Chemistry and Crime: From Sherlock Holmes to Modern Forensic Science (Not offered 2009-2010)
In this course, designed for students who do not plan to major in the natural sciences, we use a case-oriented approach to explore selected topics of forensic
science. These include: (1) the scientific and technological foundation for the examination of physical, chemical, and biological items of evidence, and (2) the
scope of expert qualifications and testimony, the legal status of scientific techniques, and the admissibility of the results in evidence. The analysis of trace evi-
dence, including glass, soil, gunpowder residues and bullet fragments, and inorganic and heavy metal poisons are discussed through an understanding of the basic
concepts of chemistry and analytical chemistry. Forensic toxicology and pharmacology are applied to the analysis of alcohol, poisons, and drugs based upon the
principles of organic chemistry and biochemistry. The characterization of blood and other body fluids necessitate an understanding of serology and molecular
genetics. The cases which stimulate the exploration of these areas include: the John and Robert Kennedy assassinations, the Jeffrey MacDonald case (Fatal
Vision), the Wayne Williams case, the deaths of celebrities Marilyn Monroe, John Belushi, and Janis Joplin, the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, the Lindberg
baby kidnapping, the Tylenol poisonings, and the identity of Anastasia.
An interactive laboratory program provides an appreciation of scientific experimentation in general and the work of a crime lab in particular. It includes an
analysis of evidence collected at various crime scenes and provides an opportunity to learn forensic techniques such as chromatography (for ink, drug, and fire
accelerant analysis), spectroscopy (for alcohol and drug analysis), and electrophoresis (for DNA fingerprinting).
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural sciences.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets and/or quizzes, hour tests, a final exam, and
laboratory performance.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30).
CHEM 115(S) AIDS: The Disease and Search for a Cure
Since the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) in 1983, modern techniques of molecular biology have revealed much about its structure and
life cycle. The intensity of the scientific investigation directed at HIV-1 is unprecedented in history. We now know more about this virus than any other known
pathogen. However, the early optimism concerning the prospects for an effective AIDS vaccine has now waned and HIV strains that are resistant to drug therapies
are common. We are now nearly three decades into the AIDS pandemic and the World Health Organization estimates that there are more than 33 million HIV-in-
fected persons worldwide.
After an introduction to chemical structure, we examine the molecular biology of the HIV virus, the molecular targets of anti-HIV drugs, and the prospects for a
cure. We look at how HIV-1 interacts with the human immune system and discuss both old and new methods of vaccine development as well as the prospects for
making an effective AIDS vaccine.
This course is designed for the non-science major who does not intend to pursue a career in the natural sciences.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, a midterm, quizzes, a final exam, and a paper/discussion.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 60).

CHEM 262T Applying the Scientific Method to Archaeology and Paleoanthropology (Same as Anthropology 262T) (Not offered 2009-2010)
(W)
How do we `know' early hominids migrated from Africa to Europe? What's the origin of Grecian pottery glazes? Archaeological studies of human environmen-
tal impact include materials as recent as nineteenth century glass, or as ancient as hundred-thousand year old stone tools. Paleoanthropology, the study of early
humans, covers materials that are millions of years old. Natural science can answer many questions, not just how old an object is, but also where, how and
89
sometimes why an object was made. These answers in turn tell us about patterns of human development and settlement, and also help us distinguish forgeries
from genuine artifacts. Understanding when we do not know an answer is also important. This tutorial will introduce science students to interesting applications,
and introduce students from anthropology, art history, or just possessing general curiosity to the methods and limits of `scientific analysis'. Given the wide scope
of this field, students will decide some of the topics. Papers will be thoroughly edited for style, grammar and syntax, as well as the quality of argument. Students
will improve their writing by integrating into successive papers the editorial comments they receive and also by editing the writing of their tutorial partners.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on five 5- to 6-page papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores.
INTRODUCTORY- AND INTERMEDIATE-LEVEL COURSES
CHEM 151(F) Concepts of Chemistry (Q)
This course provides a general introduction to chemistry for those students who are anticipating professional study in chemistry, in related sciences, or in one of
the health professions, as well as for those students who are interested in exploring the fundamental ideas of chemistry as part of their general education. In
addition to presenting an overview of chemical concepts, the course provides the foundation for the further study of organic chemistry, physical chemistry, and
biochemistry, and it gives special attention to the principles of qualitative and quantitative analysis.
The principal topics include chemical bonding, molecular structure, stoichiometry, chemical equilibrium, acid-base reactions, oxidation-reduction reactions, solu-
bility equilibria, and related applications. Laboratory work comprises a system of qualitative analysis and quantitative techniques.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, four hours per week. Evaluation will be based on quantitative weekly problem set assignments, laboratory work
and reports, quizzes, one hour test, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: basic proficiency in mathematics as demonstrated in the diagnostic test administered to all first-year students at the beginning of the academic year.
In lieu of that, Chemistry 151 may be taken concurrently with Mathematics 100/101/102--see under Mathematics. Chemistry 151 or its equivalent is prerequisite
to Chemistry 156. Those students with a strong background in chemistry from high school are encouraged to consider Chemistry 153 or 155. No enrollment limit

CHEM 324 Enzyme Kinetics and Reaction Mechanisms (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Enzymes are complex biological molecules capable of catalyzing chemical reactions with very high efficiency, stereo-selectivity and specificity. The study of
enzymatically-catalyzed reactions gives insight into the study of organic reaction mechanisms in general, and into the topic of catalysis especially. This course
explores the methods and frameworks for determining mechanisms of enzymatic reactions. These methods are based on a firm foundation of chemical kinetics
and organic reaction mechanisms. The first portion of the course is devoted to enzyme kinetics and catalysis including discussions of transition state theory,
structure-reactivity relationships, Michaelis-Menten parameters, pH-dependence of catalysis, and methods for measuring rate constants. As the course prog-
resses, the concepts of mechanism and its elucidation is applied to specific enzymatic processes as we discuss reaction intermediates and stereochemistry of
enzymatic reactions. Our discussions of modern methods include the use of altered reactants, including mechanism-based inactivators and genetically modified
enzymes as tools for probing enzymatic reactions.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, quizzes, a midterm exam, a paper, and a final exam.

CHEM 336 Materials Chemistry (Not offered 2009-2010)
Materials Science is a very broad term which describes the study of bulk physical properties of substances, such as hardness, electrical conductivity, optical
properties, and elasticity. Materials chemists bridge the gap between traditional synthetic chemists and materials scientists, by working to understand the relation-
ships between bulk physical properties and molecular structure. Many areas of chemistry are grouped under the heading of materials chemistry including polymer
chemistry, solid state chemistry, liquid crystals, conducting polymers, superconductors, and buckyballs. Materials science holds the promise for the design of new
technologies and devices; in this course, we examine some of the latest developments in materials chemistry, as well as some potential applications of emerging
technologies.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation is based on problem sets, reviews of research articles, hour exams, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Chemistry 251/255. No enrollment limit (expected: 15).
CHEM 341(S) Toxicology and Cancer (Same as Environmental Studies 341)
What is a poison and what makes it poisonous? Paracelcus commented in 1537: "What is not a poison? All things are poisons (and nothing is without poison).
The dose alone keeps a thing from being a poison." Is the picture really this bleak; is modern technology-based society truly swimming in a sea of toxic materials?
How are the nature and severity of toxicity established, measured and expressed? Do all toxic materials exert their effect in the same manner, or can materials be
poisonous in a variety of different ways? Are the safety levels set by regulatory agencies low enough for a range of common toxic materials, such as mercury,
lead, and certain pesticides? How are poisons metabolized and how do they lead to the development of cancer? What is cancer and what does it take to cause it?
What biochemical defense mechanisms exist to counteract the effects of poisons?
This course attempts to answer these questions by surveying the fundamentals of modern chemical toxicology and the induction and progression of cancer.
Topics will range from description and quantitation of the toxic response, including risk assessment, to the basic mechanisms underlying toxicity, mutagenesis,
carcinogenesis, and DNA repair.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on two hour tests, a class presentation and paper, participation in discussion sessions, a self-explo-
ration of the current toxicological literature, and a final exam.

codynamics-the interactions between drugs and their targets that elicit a biological effect-and pharmacokinetics-the study of how the body absorbs, distributes,
metabolizes, and eliminates drugs. The path of drug development is traced from discovery of an initial lead, through optimization of structure, to patenting and
production. Mechanisms by which drugs target cell membranes, nucleic acids, and proteins are discussed. Drug interactions with enzyme and receptor targets are
studied extensively. Specific drug classes selected for detailed analysis may include opiate analgesics, aspirin and other NSAIDs, antibacterial agents, cholinergic
& adrenergic agents, CNS agents, as well as antiviral, antiulcer, and anticholesterol drugs.

CLASSICS (Div. I)
Chair, Professor KERRY CHRISTENSEN
Professors: CHRISTENSEN, HOPPIN. Assistant Professors: DEKEL, RUBIN, WILCOX*.
The course offerings in Classics enable students to explore the ancient Greek, Roman, and Greco-Roman worlds from various perspectives: art, archaeology,
philosophy, religion, and especially literature and history. Courses are of two types: language (Greek and Latin) and translation (Classical Civilization). The
100-level language courses are intensive introductions to Greek and Latin grammar; the 200-level language courses combine comprehensive grammar review
with readings from Greek or Latin texts of pivotal historical periods; the 400-level language courses explore in depth selected authors or topics and the methods of
analysis appropriate to each of them. Courses in which texts are read in translation provide both introductory surveys and opportunities for more specialized study
of the ancient Greco-Roman world from earliest historical times through late antiquity.
MAJOR
Majors and prospective majors are encouraged to consult with the department's faculty to ensure a well-balanced and comprehensive selection of Classics
courses appropriate to their individual interests. A course or courses in ancient history are strongly recommended. Majors may also benefit from advice on
courses offered in other departments which would complement their particular interests in Classics. A reading knowledge of French, German, and Italian is useful
for any study in Classics and is required in at least two of these modern languages by graduate programs in classics, ancient history, classical art and archaeology,
and medieval studies.
The department offers two routes to the major: Classics and Classical Civilization.
Classics: (1) Six courses in Greek and/or Latin, with at least two 400-level courses in one language; (2) Three additional courses, elected from the
offerings in Greek, Latin, or Classical Civilization or from approved courses in other departments.
Classical Civilization: (1) Either Classics 101 or 102 and one of Classics 222, 223, or 235; (2) Three additional courses from the offerings in Classical Civiliza-
tion or from approved courses in other departments. (3) Three courses in Greek or Latin with at least one at the 400 level, or four courses in Latin at any level; (4)
A senior independent study is normally required to complete the Classical Civilization major. Several of the courses elected, including the independent study,
should relate to each other in such a way as to reflect a concentration on a particular genre, period, or problem of Greek and Roman civilization, including topics in
ancient art and archaeology, religion in the Greco-Roman world, and ancient philosophy.
A number of courses from other departments are cross-listed with Classics and so when offered may be elected for the major, including ArtH 213 Greek Art
and Myth, Philosophy 221 Greek Philosophy and 330 Plato, and Religion 210 Reading Jesus, Writing Gospels. Appropriate courses that are not cross-listed may
also count toward the major with the approval of the Chair of Classics. Examples of such courses, which vary from year to year, are Art History 105 Picturing
God in the Middle Ages, History 225 The Middle Ages, Religion/Jewish Studies 201 The Hebrew Bible, Religion 212 The Development of Christianity, and
Political Science 231 Ancient Political Thought.
Senior Colloquium: Senior majors are required to enroll in CLAS 499 in both semesters. The topics and activities of this colloquium, which normally meets
every other week for an hour, vary according to the interests of the participants. Junior majors are also encouraged to participate.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN CLASSICS
Students who wish to be considered for the degree with honors will normally present a thesis or pursue appropriate independent study in the fall and winter
study of their senior year. The thesis or independent study offers students the opportunity to work in depth on a topic of their choosing and to apply and develop
the techniques and critical methods with which they have become acquainted during their regular course work. It may also include relevant work with members
of other departments. In order to write a thesis, students normally must have a minimum GPA of 3.3 in their major courses and must submit a thesis proposal
before the end of the spring semester of their junior year that earns departmental approval. To be awarded the degree with honors in Classics, the student is
required to have taken a minimum of ten semester courses in the department (not including the thesis or independent study) and to have demonstrated original or
superior ability in studies in the field both through course work and through the thesis or equivalent independent study.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
Language Courses: The numbering of courses through the 300 level reflects the prerequisites involved. The only prerequisite for any 400-level course is Greek
201 or Latin 302, or equivalent language preparation. The numbering of the 400-level courses partially reflects the order in which they are offered over a two-year
period for Greek and a three-year period for Latin. It also indicates a good order in which to take the 400-level courses but not an essential order, and individual
students may enter the sequence at any point. While not every student will take every course, the rotation of 400-level courses is arranged to permit exposure, in a
three- to four-year period, to most of the important periods and genres of classical studies.
Classical Civilization Courses: The numbering of these courses often suggests a recommended but rarely necessary sequence of study within a given area of
classical studies. Most of the translation courses do not assume prior experience in Classics or a cross-listed field.
STUDY ABROAD
We strongly encourage Classics majors to study abroad in their junior year, at programs in Italy (especially the semester-length program at the Intercollegiate
Center for Classical Studies in Rome), at programs in Greece (especially the College Year in Athens, which students need only attend for one semester), and in the
Williams at Oxford Program. Our majors have also had excellent Classics experiences in other study-abroad programs in Italy and Greece and at various universi-
ties in Europe and the United Kingdom. In addition, we encourage students to take advantage of opportunities available in the summer: study abroad programs in
Italy and Greece, archaeological digs, or even carefully planned individual travel to sites in Greece, Italy or other areas of the ancient Greco-Roman world. When
the college cannot do so, the department may be able to provide some financial support for summer study abroad. So that students may learn more about all these
opportunities, as well as how best to prepare for them, the department holds open meetings twice each year. The department's faculty are always available to
advise students, the chair has materials to share, and students can visit the department's website for information and links to helpful internet sites.
CLASSICAL CIVILIZATION
CLAS 101 The Trojan War (Same as Comparative Literature 107) (Not offered 2009-2010)
"The Trojan War" may or may not have taken place near the end of the Bronze Age (c. 1100), but it certainly provided poets, visual artists, historians, philoso-
phers, and many others in archaic and classical Greece (750-320) with a rich discourse in which to engage questions about gender, exchange, desire, loss, and
remembrance, and about friendship, marriage, family, army, city-state and religious cult. This discourse of "The Trojan War" attained a remarkable coherence yet
also thrived on substantial variations and changes over the 300-400 years of Greek literature we will explore, a dynamic of change and continuity that has per-
sisted through the more than two millenia of subsequent Greek, Roman, Western, and non-Western participation in this discourse. More than half the course will
be devoted to the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey, after which we will read brief selections from lyric poetry (e.g. Sappho of Lesbos) and then several tragedies (e.g.,
Aeschylus' Oresteia, Sophocles' Ajax, and Euripides' Trojan Women). Depending on time and on the particular interests of the class, we may briefly consider a
few short selections from other ancient Greek and Roman authors and/or one or two modern poets. We will also watch several films, e.g., Troy, Oh Brother, Where
Art Thou?, Gods and Monsters, Fight Club, In the Bedroom, Grand Illusion, Zorba the Greek.
Format: discussion with short lectures. Evaluation will be based on a series of short papers involving close textual analysis, two 5-page papers, and contributions
to class discussion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 50 (expected: 50). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores, and to majors in Classics and Comparative Litera-
ture. Not open to students who have taken CLAS 101/COMP 107, Greek Literature, or CLAS 224/WGST 224/COMP 244, Helen, Desire and Language.

2010-2011)
In the first book of Vergil's Aeneid, the god Jupiter prophesies the foundation and the greatness of Rome: "I place no limits on their fortunes and no time; I grant
them empire without end." Yet elsewhere in this epic account of Rome's origins, this promise of unlimited power for the descendants of Romulus seems to be
seriously abridged. Some readers have seen, not only in the Aeneid but throughout classical Roman literature, a persistent tendency to inscribe the decay and
disintegration of Roman power into the very works that proclaim and celebrate Roman preeminence. This course explores the ancient Romans' own interpreta-
tions of their past, their present, and their destiny: the humble beginnings of their city, its rise to supreme world power, and premonitions of its decline. Related
topics for our consideration will include Roman constructions of gender, the location and expression of virtue in public and private spheres, the connections and
conflicts between moral probity and political success, the exercise of individual power versus action on behalf of the commonwealth, the absorption of foreign
customs and peoples into Rome, the management of literal and imaginary frontiers, and other anxieties of empire. We will read selections and complete works by
a wide variety of Roman authors, including Cicero, Catullus, Caesar, Vergil, Sallust, Horace, Ovid, Seneca, and Tacitus. All readings will be in translation.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on short written assignments, midterm and final exams with essays, and contributions to class discussion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15). Preference will be given to first-year students and sophomores and to majors in Classics and Comparative
Literature.

CLAS 105 The Ancient Novel (Same as Comparative Literature 113) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
The "rise of the novel" is often linked to the Industrial Revolution, but a number of fictional prose narratives most aptly described as novels were composed and
widely read under the Roman empire. While the Roman novels of Petronius (Satyrica or Satyricon) and Apuleius (Metamorphoses, or The Golden Ass) are better
known today, Greek romances recounting the tribulations of unfortunate young lovers, such as Longus' Daphnis and Chloe and An Ethiopian Story by Heliodo-
rus, enjoyed enormous popular success in their own time. In this course we will read a good number (seven or so) of the ancient novels that are extant today. To
situate these works in their original cultural context, we will consider the historical evidence for their production, circulation, and readership. We will also study
these works as precursors of the modern novel, examining, for example, their concern or disregard for realism, and their treatment of the grotesque, miraculous,
and fantastic. We will give equal attention to the relationship these novels bear to other ancient genres, such as satire, pastoral, epic, and "Lives," including those
of saints.
Format: discussion, with occasional short lectures. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class, a midterm, several short papers and one longer, final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15-20). Preference will be given to majors and prospective majors in Classics and Comparative Literature, and
to sophomores and first-years.

CLAS 224 Helen, Desire and Language (Same as Comparative Literature 244 and Women's and Gender Studies 224) (Not offered
2009-2010) (W)
When Homer's Iliad introduces us to "Helen of Troy," she is a perfectly beautiful and baleful cause of the Trojan War and, simultaneously, among its most
sympathetic and innocent victims. In her struggle to be a desiring agent and not simply the passive screen onto which others project their own desires, Helen
stands both inside the narrative, as a character created by it, and outside, as a commentator on the story and her own role in it. Through Helen as much as any other
character, the Iliad explores the relation between logos and eros. Because Helen remains a key figure in Greek discourse of language and desire, and of death, loss,
memory, repetition and substitution, we will focus on texts in which Helen figures prominently, including the Iliad and Odyssey, lyric poems by Sappho, Alcaeus,
and Steisichorus, Aeschylus's Oresteia, Euripides's Helen, and Gorgias' Encomium of Helen, and we will consider Helen in the graphic arts and religious cults.
We will also venture into texts and arenas where Helen herself is not prominent or even mentioned but where thematics familiar from stories involving her are at
play, e.g. Hesiod on the Muses, Pandora, Aphrodite, and Metis, several tragedies by Sophocles and Euripides, the Athenian cult of Persuasion, women's roles in
familial and communal cults, and (if time permits) Plato's Symposium or Phaedrus.
Among the questions we will ask: Why do discussions of logos regularly become discussions of eros, and vice-versa? Why do "feminine" activities--weaving,
storing and preparing food, bearing children, caring for the dead--and why do traits particularly associated in Greek culture with females--lying and seductive-
ness, for instance--figure prominently in the discourse of logos and eros? Does this discourse engender as "feminine" poets, texts, and characters who, like
Achilles and Odysseus as well as Helen, become "poets" within the texts that have created them? Where is "masculinity" located in this discourse?
Format: discussion with some short lectures. Requirements: active participation in class discussion, one or two oral presentations, several shorter papers and a
longer final paper (more than 20 pages total). Students may devise a final paper involving later literature either about Helen or otherwise relevant to the issues in
this course.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to students who have previously studied some of the literature being read and to
majors in Classics, Comparative Literature, Literary Studies, English and other literatures and in Women's and Gender Studies.

CLAS 235(F) Introduction to Roman Archaeology and Material Culture (Same as History 224)
This course examines the development of Roman archaeology and the material culture that is its focus from the early Iron Age, ca. 1000 BCE, to the end of reign
of Constantine in 337 CE. The primary goal of the course is to help students understand the social and historical context in which Roman material culture was
created and used. We will consider a variety of evidence from across the empire including monumental and domestic architecture, wall painting, mosaics, sculp-
ture, coins and inscriptions. Special emphasis will be placed on the city of Rome; however, we will also look at other important urban centers, such as Pompeii,
Ephesus and Alexandria. Class discussions will focus on issues related to gender, ethnicity and cultural identity in the Roman Empire. For example, what does it
mean to be "Roman" in terms of language, ethnicity and cultural institutions? Roman art and architecture was not the product of any single people or culture, but
rather the hybrid synthesis of a complex cultural negotiation between the Romans and their colonial subjects (i.e., Greeks, Jews, Celts, etc.). We will also discuss
how Roman elites used material culture to convey political messages and social status in the imperial hierarchy, as well as the legacy of Roman art and architec-
ture in the modern world.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, one 8- to 10-page paper, a midterm, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 30). Preference given to majors or prospective majors in Classics, History, Art History, and Anthropology.

CLAS 238(S) Identity, Geography and Politics in the Roman Empire (Same as History 341)
During the first century BCE, successive civil wars divided the Roman Empire along ethnic, geographical and partisan lines. Octavian's victory at battle of
Actium in 31 BCE officially brought an end to the Roman civil wars, but it did not in itself unify the empire. It is out of this matrix of social fragmentation and
uncertainty that the geographical texts of the Augustan age arose. The genre of universal geography provided a convenient means to reconfigure identity bound-
aries in post-Actium world. By delineating stable borders between the peoples and provinces, geographical texts (whether written, sculptural or pictorial) literally
mapped out identity boundaries and power relationships to create a new, unified image of the Roman Empire. This course examines the political and cosmologi-
cal of implications geographical sources produced under the Roman Empire, including the Res Gestae of Augustus, Strabo's Geography and Tacitus' Germania.
We will also look at maps and other visual representations of the Roman world, such as the personification groups depicted on the Roman imperial cult temples at
Aphrodisias and Pisidian Antioch. Discussion will focus on issues such as the relationship between geography and ethnography and the differences between
modern cartography and the geographical mapping techniques used in the ancient world.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on classroom performance, quizzes, one 8- to 10-page paper, a midterm, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25. Preference given to majors or prospective majors in Classics, Anthropology, and History.

CLAS 239 The Construction of Gender in Ancient Greece and Rome (Same as History 322 and Women's and Gender Studies 239) (Not
offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
The inferior political status and heavily circumscribed lives of women in ancient Greek and Roman societies have received extensive study in recent decades. Yet
it is nearly impossible to understand women's lives without also studying the often stringent cultural norms that governed men's lives as well. This course seeks to
understand these aspects of Greek and Roman societies over time as expectations for the behaviors, priorities, and activities of both women and men evolved.
While the impact of these gendered expectations on the lives of men and women often varied considerably in kind and degree, their interplay was at the same time
often intricate, and many that constructed women's lives could only be articulated with reference to corresponding expectations for men. Others emerged only
during times of crisis and could even involve a reversal of the usual roles of men and women. Some norms gave men and women a shared experience that is rare
in other societies.
We will explore these and related issues by reading widely in such ancient authors as Homer, Sappho, Herodotus, the Greek tragedians, Greek and Roman
94
philosophers, Vergil and other Latin poets, and Roman didactic writers. We will also read modern scholarship on such subjects as the family, prostitution, the
exposure of unwanted infants, demography, and the anthropology of gender in both Greek and Roman societies.
Format: lecture and discussion. Evaluation will be based on class preparation and participation, two short 5- to 7-page papers, a midterm, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15).

CLAS 262(S) Performing Greece and Rome (Same as Theatre 262 and Comparative Literature 270)
Since their beginnings in fifth-century Athens, tragedy and comedy have always been translations of something else. The tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles and
Euripides and the comedies of Aristophanes were hybrids of various poetic, musical and dance genres first developed for a variety of different performance
occasions. This class, which will be team-taught by a classics professor and a stage-director who have collaborated in the past on Williamstheatre productions of
Greek tragedies, will examine selected dramatic texts from ancient Greece and Rome as literary artifacts and as documents intended for translation into perfor-
mance. We hope that our interdisciplinary approach will stimulate a wide-ranging consideration of these enormously influential plays.
In addition to scrutinizing the relation of the texts to what we know of ancient production practice, we will illuminate these archaic stagings by analogy to a
number of surviving performance traditions in such places as contemporary Japan, China, Indonesia and Africa. We will also trace successive translations and
hybridizations of these plays through history to the stages of modern Paris, Berlin, Johannesburg, London, Athens, Kabul, and New York. The class will include a
modest number of workshops in performance in order to begin to develop a kinesthetic sense of the production practices we examine.
Format: discussion and some workshops. Evaluation will be based on contributions to discussion, effort in workshops, and several short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to majors or prospective majors in Classics, Theatre, and Comparative Literature.

CLGR 201(F) Intermediate Greek
Reading of selections from Hesiod and from Plato, combined with grammar review. The primary goal of this course is to develop fluency in reading Greek. We
will also read the texts closely to explore important continuities and changes in Greek culture between the archaic and classical periods. The emphasis will vary
from year to year, but possible subjects to be explored include: the education and socialization of the community's children and young adults; religion and cult
practices; the performative aspects of epic (and choral) poetry and of prose genres like oratory and the philosophical dialogue; traditional oral poetry and storytell-
ing and the growth of literacy; the construction of woman, of man; the development of the classical polis.

CLGR 402 Homer: The Iliad (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
From the early archaic era through the classical and beyond, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey simultaneously influenced and reflected Greek conceptions of communi-
ty, leadership, war, heroism, family, loyalty, the gods, justice, and much more. Nearly all of subsequent Greek literature, both poetry and prose, developed dia-
logue with these early epic texts. In this course we will read extensive selections from the Iliad in Greek and the entire epic in translation, focusing on the oral
tradition and societal background in which it is rooted and on the unique structure and character of the poem itself.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, oral reports, a midterm and final exams, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Greek 201 or permission of instructor. Greek 402 is offered alternately as a course on the Iliad and the Odyssey. Students who have taken Greek 402
on the Odyssey may elect this course as well. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 5-10).

Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR HOPPIN
CLGR 403(F) Poetry and Revolution in Archaic Greece
The age of experiment, lyric poetry, tyranny, migration and discovery, and the personal voice: it takes many images to describe the profound changes in Greek
society, thought, and self-expression that took place during the archaic era (roughly 800 BCE to the Persian invasion of 479 BCE). We will first read selections
from the lyric poets (e.g. Archilochus and Sappho, Tyrtaeus and Solon), whose concise and expressive poems reflected contemporary culture in a way that the
archaic epics did not. Their poems create for modern readers, as they did for the Greeks, a powerful sense of the poet's personal presence and engagement with his
(or her) audience. A similar intimacy characterizes the writings of many of the pre-Socratics, from which we will next read selections. Confident in the ability of
the human mind to understand both the human and the physical world, the pre-Socratics anticipated what came to be known as philosophy and natural science.
We will then turn to other writers who spoke directly about the political upheavals of the archaic age, focussing on the "tyrant narratives" of Herodotus. Through-
out the semester we will also consider such significant material changes in the archaic era as the development of monumental public sculpture, the evolution of the
temple, and the undertaking of vast building programs, all of which transformed the visual scale of the Greek cities and their citizens' sense of self and communi-
ty.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on daily translations and contributions to class discussion, several translation quizzes, an oral presentation,
a final paper, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Greek 201 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 5-6).

CLGR 404 Tragedy (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Tragedy was a hybrid genre invented in sixth-fifth century Athens, where tragic performances in the city's festival of the Greater Dionysia played a vital role in the
democratic polis. This course will focus on reading in Greek a complete tragedy of Sophokles or Euripides; we will also read in translation several other tragedies,
a satyr-play, and a comedy of Aristophanes. While focusing on questions of particular importance for the play we are reading in Greek, we will also situate that
play in a larger context by exploring, for instance: aspects of the social and political situations in and for which tragedies were produced; the several performance
genres out of which tragedy was created; developments in the physical characteristics of the theater and in elements of staging and performance; problems of
95
representation particularly relevant to theatrical production and performance.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class, several 1- to 2-page papers involving close textual analysis, perhaps a midterm
exam, a final exam, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Greek 201 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 4-5).

CLGR 405 Greek Lyric Poetry (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This course will explore the development of Greek lyric poetry from the eighth to the fifth centuries BCE. Beginning with Archilochus, Sappho, and Alcaeus, and
proceeding through such poets as Solon, Anacreon, Ibycus, and Theognis, we will examine the formal, social, and performative contexts of lyric, the influence of
epic and choral poetry on the evolution of the genre, and the difficulties of evaluating a fragmentary corpus. Finally, we will explore the influence of political and
economic changes in the early fifth century on the work of Simonides. The goal throughout is to investigate the structures, innovations, and problems of poetic
self-expression in early Greek poetry.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a midterm exam, a final paper, and a final exam. Prerequisites: Greek 201 or permission of the
instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 5).

CLGR 406T Coming of Age in the Polis (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 406T) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
Studying a society's modes of rearing its young, and especially the ways it prepares and tests adolescents for their "coming of age" into their adult roles, provides
an excellent approach to exploring its fundamental values and institutional practices. Archaic and classical Greek literature not only reflects but actively reflects
upon the socialization of boys and girls in the Greek polis. In this course we will read in Greek selections from the Homeric Hymns to Demeter and Apollo and, in
its entirety, a tragedy (e.g., Sophocles' Philoctetes), examining these texts through the lens of "coming of age." We will read in English brief selections from
Homeric epic and from elegiac and lyric poetry (monodic and choral), and several Athenian tragedies and perhaps a comedy. We will also read critical literature
on childrearing, religious cults for boys and girls of different ages, and the role of dance, song and poetry in preparing the young for their adult roles, particularly in
fifth-century Athens.
Students will be divided into tutorial pairs chiefly according to their previous experience in Greek courses. Students will meet with the instructor once a week
either individually or in pairs to present their translations of the Greek assigned for that week, and they will also meet once a week in pairs for the oral presentation
of written 5-page reports. At the latter meeting, each student will alternate between making a formal presentation one week and, in the next week, offering an oral
critique of the other student's presentation.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on the translations, reports, and critiques presented in the tutorial sessions.
Prerequisites: Greek 201 or permission of instructor. Enrollment: 10 (expected: 6-8).

CLGR 407 Rhetoric and Democracy: the Greek Orators (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
The Greek orators of the 4th-century BCE have left us a rich and varied body of work. They were specialists in rhetoric and persuasive discourse, and in the
deployment of the one to produce the other. They wrote forensic oratory intended to sway juries, often with little reference to the facts of the case; political
speeches with which they argued policy before the Athenian Assembly and aspired to be the city's leaders; attack speeches which they hoped would destroy their
rivals; and show pieces intended to dazzle the listener with their rhetorical brilliance. Political careers were launched not by the noble birth and military success
that were so important in the previous century, but by high-profile prosecutions won by oratorical prowess. In their own words, the most influential orators of
4th-century Athens will instruct us in rhetoric, demonstrate the stylistic versatility of the Greek language, teach us about what Athenians in the 4th century cared
about, reveal theories of human psychology, and persuade us of a thing or two. We will read selected speeches by Lysias, Aeschines, and Demosthenes, as well as
portions of speeches by other orators such as Isocrates, Antiphon, and Dinarchus.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class translation and discussion, several short exercises, a midterm, a final paper, and a final translation exam.
Prerequisites: Greek 201 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 6-8).

CLLA 302(S) Vergil's Aeneid
This course is a comprehensive introduction to Vergil's Aeneid. Students will develop their ability to read and translate the Latin text of the poem, while at the
same time exploring the major interpretive issues surrounding the definitive Roman epic. Through a combination of close reading and large-scale analysis, we
will investigate the poem's literary, social, and political dimensions with special attention to Vergil's consummate poetic craftsmanship.

This course will explore the ancient Roman epistolary tradition. Through selections from the three major surviving collections of letters by Cicero, Pliny, and
Seneca, as well as modern critical approaches to the genre, we will investigate the formal and stylistic conventions and innovations of Roman personal, political,
and philosophical letter writing. We will also consider the problem of distinguishing real correspondence from literary fabrication, as well as issues related to
self-presentation, friendship, and the role of letters in Roman public and private life. Finally, we will turn to the poetic appropriation of this tradition in Ovid's
Heroides, a collection of fictional letters from mythological heroines.
Format: discussion/recitation. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a midterm exam, a short paper, and a final exam.

CLLA 403(F) The Invention of Love: Catullus and the Roman Elegists
This course will explore the development of Latin love poetry in the first century BCE. Beginning with Catullus, we will examine the influence of Greek lyric
poetry on the evolution of the genre as well as Roman attitudes toward love exhibited in other literature of the Late Republic. We will then turn to the full develop-
ment of the elegiac form in the love poems of Propertius, Tibullus, and Sulpicia. Finally, we will explore the transformation of the genre in Ovid's Amores. The
goal throughout is to investigate the conventions, innovations, and problems of expressing personal desire and longing amid the social and political upheaval of
the transition from Republic to Principate.
Format: discussion/recitation. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a midterm exam, a final paper, and a final exam.

CLLA 405(S) Livy and Tacitus: Myth, Scandal, and Morality in Ancient Rome
Mythical stories of Rome's founding, which were formulated by many generations of Roman authors and public figures, served as a framework for these very
thinkers to analyze and articulate Roman self-image in rich and creative ways; one who stands out among these figures is the Augustan historian Livy. The
96
"second founding" of the Republic by Augustus, and the careers of his successors, in turn gave later Roman writers like Tacitus fresh inspiration for Roman
self-imagining and self-analysis.
We will begin the semester in mythical Rome, reading selections from Book 1 of Livy's history which present figures like Aeneas, the Trojan refugee whose
arrival in Italy was conceptually crucial to Rome's development and position in Italy and the Mediterranean; Romulus, by whom Rome was founded in an act of
fratricide; the Sabine women, whose nobility prevented a deadly war between their fathers and their Roman kidnappers; and Lucretia, whose virtue and self-sacri-
fice led to the liberation of Rome from a decadent and violent monarchy and to the founding of the Roman Republic. We will examine how Livy deploys the
storyteller's art to excite his readers' pathos, indignation, and sympathy; we will examine as well how Livy often filters his account of mythical Rome through the
lens of his own time, thereby constructing Rome's past through the Augustan present.
Writing more than a century after Livy, Tacitus offers a different view of Augustus, and his account of the rude and dissolute Tiberius, the unscrupulous Livia,
Rome's craven and dispirited senators, and the many scandals attached to the imperial family, figures a Rome once again suffering under a decadent monarchy.
Tacitus's compressed, fastidious, inimitable prose is the vehicle for his stern yet often sardonic psychological insights, which subtly manage to combine moral
judgment with prurient pleasure in the scandals of others.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class preparation and participation, an 8- to 10-page paper, a midterm, and a final exam.

CLLA 406 Horace Odes 1-3 (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Nietzsche claimed that he never had an artistic delight comparable to his experience of reading a Horatian ode. Through close readings of selected odes in Books
1-3 we will seek to experience such delight for ourselves and to learn why, as Nietzsche put it, "what is here achieved is in certain languages not even to be hoped
for." We will examine the relation between poetic landscapes, poetic programs and the poetry's exploration of subjects like love, friendship, youth and old age,
death, politics, private morality; the poet's capacity to define himself by offering his own account of poetic traditions and his place in them; the variety of voices
and perspectives within individual poems and throughout the collection; the demands thereby placed on the poet's audience and the power of the poetry to
transform an audience equal to those demands. It is in terms of this transformational power of poetry that we will consider Horace's relationship to his contempo-
raries, particularly Vergil, his patron Maecenas, and Augustus.
Evaluation will be based on contributions in the classroom, two 2- to 3-page papers (translation with comments), a short memorization assignment, perhaps a
midterm, a final paper, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Latin 302 or permission of instructor.
HOPPIN
CLLA 407 Caesar and Cicero (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2011-2012)
The one a brilliant strategist, the other preeminent in the courts, Caesar and Cicero were both master politicians whose ambitions for themselves and for their
country brought them into bitter conflict. Their combined oeuvres provide compelling, detailed accounts of the events and personalities that ended the Roman
republic and ushered in an era of prolonged civil war. Moreover, despite striking differences, their works can justifiably be claimed to be the twin summits of
classical Latin prose. In this course we will read extensive selections from Caesar's commentarii (the Bellum Gallicum and Bellum Civile) and from Cicero's
speeches and letters, aiming throughout at a better understanding of these authors' stylistic achievements as well as the pragmatic persuasive goals that drove their
rhetoric.
Format: recitation/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short written assignments (such as article reviews), a midterm exam and
essay of moderate length, plus a final exam and longer paper.
Prerequisites: Latin 302 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit:12 (expected: 6-9).
WILCOX
CLLA 408 Roman Comedy (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Roman comedy flourished only briefly, between the second and third Punic Wars, but its cultural-historical importance is undeniable. In these fabulae palliatae,
Latin comedies staged in Greek costume and featuring ostensibly Greek characters, Roman attitudes are questioned and mocked, but ultimately reasserted. We
will read the Menaechmi of Plautus and the Adelphoe of Terence, two plays that burlesque the stereotypical relationships between fathers, brothers, sons, and
slaves. We will also consider selections from Cato the Elder, Cicero's letters, and other primary and secondary texts that shed additional light on Roman familial
relationships and their place in republican society.
Format: discussion/recitation. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short papers, a midterm and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Latin 302 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 8-10).
WILCOX
CLLA 409 Seneca and the Self (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Through a close reading of selections from his Dialogues, Epistulae Morales, and a tragedy (probably Medea), this course will consider ethical and literary
dimensions of self-fashioning, self-examination, and the conception of self in the Stoic philosophy of the younger Seneca. The focus of this course lies squarely in
the first century CE, and on the analysis of Seneca's own texts. We will begin, however, with an introduction to the ethics of Roman Stoicism through the perso-
nae theory of Panaetius as recorded in Cicero's De Officiis. Moreover, we will read and discuss selections from some of Seneca's most famous and influential
interpreters, including Montaigne and Foucault, in order to enrich our understanding of contemporary assessments of his work and to gain an appreciation of
Seneca's considerable influence on later theorizations of selfhood.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short written and oral assignments, midterm and final exams, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Latin 302 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 5-10).

COGNITIVE SCIENCE (Div. II)
Chair, Associate Professor SAFA ZAKI
Advisory Committee: Professors: DANYLUK***, KIRBY***, H. WILLIAMS. Associate Professors: CRUZ, ZAKI. Assistant Professor: KOR-
NELL.
Cognitive science is concerned with how humans, non-human animals, and computers acquire, represent, manipulate, and use information. As an interdisci-
plinary field it combines research and theory from computer science (e.g., artificial intelligence), cognitive psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and neuroscience,
and to some extent evolutionary biology, math, and anthropology. Complex issues of cognition are not easily addressed using traditional intra-disciplinary tools.
Cognitive researchers in any discipline typically employ a collection of analytic and modeling tools from across traditional disciplinary boundaries. Thus, the
methods and research agenda of cognitive science are broader than those of any of the fields that have traditionally contributed to cognitive science. The Cogni-
tive Science Program is designed to provide students with the broad interdisciplinary foundation needed to approach issues of cognition.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Cognitive Science consists of six courses, including an introductory course, four electives, and a senior seminar.
Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior (COGS 222) is the entry point into the concentration, and provides an interdisciplinary perspective on issues of cogni-
tion. Ideally, it should be taken before the end of the sophomore year. Emphasizing the highly interdisciplinary nature of the field, the four electives must be
distributed over at least three course prefixes. In the fall of the senior year, concentrators will participate in a senior seminar (COGS 493).
REQUIRED COURSES

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COGNITIVE SCIENCE
Formal admission to candidacy for honors will occur at the end of the fall semester of the senior year and will be based on promising performance in COGS
493. This program will consist of COGS W31-494(S), and will be supervised by members of the advisory committee from at least two departments. Presentation
of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who wish to discuss plans for study abroad are invited to meet with any member of the Cognitive Science advisory committee.
COGS 222(F) Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science (Same as Philosophy 222 and Psychology 222)
This course will emphasize interdisciplinary approaches to the study of intelligent systems, both natural and artificial. Cognitive science synthesizes research
from cognitive psychology, computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, and contemporary philosophy. Special attention will be given to the philosophical
foundations of cognitive science, representation and computation in symbolic and connectionist architectures, concept acquisition, problem solving, perception,
language, semantics, reasoning, and artificial intelligence.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: midterm and final exams, and self-paced weekly computer lab exercises.
Prerequisites: Psychology 101 or Philosophy 102 or Computer Science 134. Background in more than one of these is recommended. Enrollment limit: 25 (ex-
pected: 25). Preference given to first-and second-year students.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR KIRBY
COGS 493(F) Senior Seminar
The goal of the cognitive science senior seminar is threefold. Firstly, we will revisit the foundations of cognitive research by reading some of the classics that
established cognitive science as a field in the middle of the 20th century. Secondly, we will engage current research trends in cognitive studies by looking at work
published in the last five years on cognitive neuroscience, embodied cognition, dynamic systems theory, empirical approaches to consciousness, and situated
robotics. In addition to attending to the specific empirical details of this latter work, we will also discuss how current research elaborates, expands, and sharpens
early conceptions of the domain and methodology of cognitive science. Our final goal will be the preparation of individual research papers by members of the
class. These will be on topics determined in collaboration with the instructor.
Students will be responsible for presentations on the assigned readings, and for the development of a final paper involving independent research.
Format: seminar or tutorial, depending on enrollment. Requirements: several short assignments, final paper, attendance and participation.
Prerequisites: required of, and open only to, senior cognitive science concentrators (though in unusual circumstances non-concentrators may take the class with
permission of the cognitive science advisory committee). Enrollment limit: number of senior concentrators.
Hour: TBA CRUZ
COGS W31-494(S) Senior Thesis
The senior concentrator, having completed the senior seminar and with approval from the advisory committee, may devote winter study and the spring semes-
ter to a senior thesis based on the fall research project.

COMPARATIVE LITERATURE (Div. I)
Chair, Professor GAIL M. NEWMAN
Professors: CASSIDAY, DRUXES, GOLDSTEIN, B. KIEFFER*, KLEINER, LIMON, NEWMAN, ROUHI, SWANN. Associate Professors: C.
BOLTON, S. FOX*, FRENCH, KAGAYA, PIEPRZAK, VANDE STADT. Assistant Professors: MARTIN, NAAMAN, NUGENT**, VAR-
GAS*. Bolin Fellow: SO.
Students motivated by a desire to study literature in the broadest terms, as well as those interested in particular examples of literary comparison, will find an
intellectual home in the Program in Comparative Literature. The Program in Comparative Literature gives students the opportunity to develop their critical facul-
ties through the analysis of literature in its international and multicultural context. By crossing national, linguistic, historical, and disciplinary boundaries, students
of Comparative Literature learn to read texts for the ways they make meaning, the assumptions that underlie that meaning, and the aesthetic elements evinced in
the making. Students of Comparative Literature are encouraged to examine the widest possible range of literary communication, including the metamorphosis of
genres, forms, and themes.
Whereas specific literature programs allow the student to trace the development of one literature in a particular culture over a period of time, Comparative
Literature juxtaposes the writings of different cultures and epochs in a variety of ways. Because interpretive methods from other disciplines play a crucial role in
investigating literature's larger context, the Program offers courses intended for students in all divisions of the college and of all interests. These include courses
that introduce students to the comparative study of world literature and courses designed to enhance any foreign language major in the Williams curriculum. In
addition, the English Department allows students to count one course with a COMP prefix as an elective within the English major.
The Program supports two distinct majors in Comparative Literature and Literary Studies. The major in Comparative Literature requires advanced work in at
least one language other than English and is strongly recommended for students contemplating graduate study in the discipline. Both majors provide a strong
basis for any career demanding analytical, interpretive, and evaluative skills and allow the student, within a framework of general requirements, to create a pro-
gram of study primarily shaped by the student's own interests.
MAJORS
Comparative Literature
The Comparative Literature major combines the focused study of a single national-language literature with a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across
national, linguistic, and historical boundaries. Each student declaring the major must select a single foreign language as his or her specialty, although the serious
study of literature in foreign languages other than the student's specialty is strongly encouraged. The languages currently available are French, German, Ancient
Greek, Latin, Russian, and Spanish. Each student will also be paired with a faculty advisor with whom the student will meet each semester to discuss how best to
fulfill the requirements for the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative
Any three comparative literature core courses. A core course is any course that meets the following criteria: a) it must treat primarily literature
and b) it must be genuinely comparative across cultures and/or primarily theoretical. The three core courses may be chosen from the offerings of
the Program in Comparative Literature or from the offerings of other departments and programs, including the foreign language programs and
English, Religion, Africana Studies, and Latino/Latina Studies.
Three literature courses in the student's specialty language, in which texts are read in the original. At least one of the three must be above the
200-level.
Three courses in which most of the course work concerns literature other than that of the student's specialty language or literary theory. These
courses may be selected from Comparative Literature offerings or from other departments and must be approved by the student's major advisor.
Only one may be in English or American literature.
Comparative Literature 401 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Students who are considering a major in Comparative Literature should aim to acquire intermediate-level proficiency in their specialty language by the end of
the sophomore year. They should also complete core course requirements by the end of their junior year. Students pursuing the Comparative Literature major are
strongly encouraged to study abroad during their junior year and may receive major credit for up to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three courses
towards the major must be at the 300 level or above. Students are expected to take the version of 401 offered in their senior year.
Literary Studies
The Literary Studies major allows for a wide-ranging exploration of literary forms across national, linguistic, and historical boundaries. Unlike the major in
Comparative Literature, the Literary Studies major does not require the student to choose a specialty language, although the serious study of literature in one or
more foreign languages is strongly encouraged. Each student will be paired with a faculty advisor, with whom the student will meet each semester to discuss how
best to fulfill the requirements for the major.
Eleven courses are required for the major:
Comparative Literature 111 The Nature of Narrative
Any four comparative literature core courses. A core course is any course that meets the following criteria: a) it must treat primarily literature and b) it
must be genuinely comparative across cultures and/or primarily theoretical. The three core courses may be chosen from the offerings of the Program in
Comparative Literature or from the offerings of other departments and programs, including the foreign language programs and English, Religion, Africa-
na Studies, and Latino/Latina Studies.
Five courses devoted to literature or literary theory that cover at least three different national/cultural traditions. The courses may be selected from Comparative
Literature offerings or from other departments and must be approved by the student's major advisor. Of the courses taken outside of the Program in Compara-
tive Literature, no more than two may have the same course prefix. Students are strongly encouraged to include courses in a foreign language among these five.
Comparative Literature 401 Senior Seminar (variable topics)
Students who are considering a major in Literary Studies should aim to complete core course requirements by the end of their sophomore year. Students who
choose to study abroad during their junior year may receive major credit for up to 4 courses taken during study abroad. At least three courses towards the major
must be at the 300 level or above. Students are expected to take the version of 401 offered in their senior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPARATIVE LITERATURE OR LITERARY STUDIES
Prerequisites
Honors candidates in Comparative Literature or Literary Studies are required to have maintained a GPA of 3.5 in the major to qualify for submitting a thesis
proposal. In addition, candidates must demonstrate a strong interest in a specific topic for which an appropriate faculty advisor will be available in the senior year.
Timing
Students wishing to pursue a thesis in Comparative Literature or Literary Studies are strongly urged to secure an advisor by the end of the week after Spring
Break in their junior year. By May 15th of their junior year, candidates must submit to the Program Advisory Committee a one- to two-page proposal and a
preliminary bibliography. The Advisory Committee will inform candidates by June 1 whether they may proceed with the thesis and advise them about any
changes that should be made in the focus or scope of the project. The summer before the senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and
preparing for the process of writing the thesis.
In their senior year, candidates will devote two semesters and the winter study period to their theses (493-W31-494). By the end of the Fall semester, students
will normally have undertaken substantial research and produced the draft of at least the first half of the project. At this point students should also have a clear
sense of the work remaining for completion of the thesis. In the course of the Fall semester, students will also have chosen and met with a second reader for the
project, who will provide additional guidance and read the final thesis. By the end of Winter Study, students should have completed a draft of the entire project. At
that time, the Comparative Literature Advisory Committee, together with the advisor, will determine whether the project may continue as an Honors Thesis, or
whether its first portions (COMP 493-W) will be graded as Independent Studies.
The second semester of independent thesis work will be spent revising as necessary. The completed thesis in its final form will be due one week before the last
day of classes. At the end of the Spring term, the student will make a public presentation of the final project, to which members of the Advisory Committee will be
specially invited.
Characteristics of the Thesis, Evaluation, and Major Credit
The topic of the thesis must be comparative and/or theoretical. It is also possible to write a thesis that consists of an original translation of a significant text or
texts; in this case, a theoretical apparatus must accompany the translation. The complete thesis must be at least 50 and at most 75 pages in length, excluding the
bibliography.
99
The advisor will assign the grades for the thesis courses (COMP 493-W-494); the Advisory Committee will determine whether a candidate will receive Hon-
ors, Highest Honors, or no honors.
For students who pursue an honors thesis, the total number of courses required for the major-including the thesis course (COMP 493-W-494)-is 12, i.e., one of
the thesis courses may substitute for one elective.
STUDY ABROAD
The Program in Comparative Literature strongly urges its students to study abroad. Students who have Comparative Literature as a major should seriously
consider study abroad in a country where their specialty language is spoken; they will likely be able to complete some of the specialty language courses required
for the major during study abroad. Literary Studies students can also benefit from study abroad; literature courses from abroad are often candidates for credit as
major electives.

literature by some of the world's great writers (as well as visual texts from graphic novels to video games) to see what they have to teach us about narrative and
language. At the same time we will also read a small selection of critical essays to help us broaden our idea of what literature can be and do. Readings will be
drawn from the Chinese classics, the Christian Bible, and the work of Bash, Woolf, Borges, Kundera, and others. The critical essays will also represent a range of
different times, places, and schools. All readings will be in English, although we will discuss issues of translation, and those with foreign language skills are
invited to make comparisons with the original where possible.

Mythologized as the land of the aurora borealis and the midnight sun, Scandinavia's five distinct nations--Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland--
are often mistakenly associated with blond-haired and blue-eyed uniformity. Modern Scandinavia, however, is a place of great social and cultural diversity. From
medieval Viking sagas to contemporary Nordic rap, the Scandinavian literary tradition is rich in tales of global exploration, childhood imagination, sexual revolu-
tion, and multicultural confrontation. Through readings of nineteenth-century drama, twentieth-century novels, and twenty-first century cinema, we will investi-
gate a wide range of issues on class, ethnicity, and identity, including the indigenous reindeer-herding Sami people, Danish colonialism and the Greenlandic Inuit,
Norwegian collaboration and resistance during World War II, and Nordic emigration (to North America) and immigration (from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and
the Middle East). Discussion will also focus on Scandinavia's leadership in gender equality and sexual liberation, Scandinavian political isolation and integration
(into both the UN and the EU), and the global effects of Nordic pop (ABBA to Bjrk), glamour (Greta Garbo to Helena Christensen), technology (Volvo to
Nokia), and design (IKEA to H&M). Readings to include works by Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, Hans Christian Andersen, Karen Blixen, Astrid Lindgren,
Halldr Laxness, Reidar Jnsson, and Peter Heg. Films to include works by Ingmar Bergman, Lasse Hallstrm, Bille August, Colin Nutley, Lukas Moodysson,
Josef Fares, and Tomas Vinterberg. All readings and discussions in English.

COMP 231T Postmodernism (Same as English 266T) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W) (D)
In one definition, postmodernism in art and literature is what you get when you combine modernism's radical experimentation with pop culture's easy appeal.
This term has been used to describe works from Andy Warhol's paintings of Campbell's soup cans and Jean Baudrillard's critical essays on Disneyland to Thom-
as Pynchon's paranoid novel about postal conspiracy, The Crying of Lot 49. Theorists of the postmodern have argued that it represents not only a radical change in
aesthetic sensibilities, but a fundamentally new relationship between art, language, and society. In this tutorial, we will read some of the most important theoretical
essays defining the postmodern (essays which themselves often embrace this playful and sometimes ironic style), and we will pair them with artistic texts that are
said to illustrate the features of postmodernism. The latter will be mainly novels and short stories from various countries, but one feature of this theory is a
flattening of the distinction between high and low culture as well as between the written and the visual, so we will also examine examples from film, architecture,
visual art, and/or broader pop culture. Along the way will ask whether global theoretical paradigms like postmodernism can help us understand other cultures
better (by locating them within a single universal system), or whether this approach conceals important cultural differences. Texts will include essays by Jean
Baudrillard, Fredric Jameson, Jean-Franois Lyotard, and others; novels and short stories by writers like Don DeLillo, Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, and
Murakami Haruki; painting and sculpture associated with Pop Art and Superflat; the architecture of Williamstown area museums; etc. Writing assignments will
focus on reading the theoretical texts critically and applying their ideas to the artistic texts in creative and interesting ways. Open to sophomores as well as
advanced students.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: After an introductory lecture meeting, students will meet with the instructor in pairs for approximately an hour each week; they
will write a 5-page paper every other week (five in all), and respond to their partners' papers in alternate weeks. Emphasis will be on understanding and engaging
the criticism that we read, and comparing the critical and fictional texts creatively in a way that sheds light on both.
Prerequisites: a 100-level literature course (Comparative Literature, English, etc.) and sophomore standing or higher, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment
limit: 10 (expected: 10). Priority will be given to students majoring in a discipline related to critical theory (or considering such a major) and those with a

COMP 242T Reading and Writing the Body (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
Am I a body, or do I have one? The tradition of favoring thought over physical experience has long informed, and limited, our sense of self as human beings.
While some writers maintain that the creative impulse is a gift of the muse and that it is rooted entirely in the mind or spirit, there are those for whom the human
body, frequently their own, plays a central role, both in the process of creation and as a subject of artistic inquiry or contemplation. In their writing, these authors
tell a very different tale with regard to the literary process, and it is focused on the primacy of the physical experience. This course will consider the work of,
among others, Maupassant, Kafka, Tanizaki, Tolstoy, Dinesen, Babel, Mandelstam, and Atwood in order to examine how writers from different cultural and
aesthetic perspectives either present or use the body as a vehicle of expression. We will also consider other areas of study that are intimately related to the physical
experience, such as asceticism, illness, prostitution, and disability, and occasionally turn our attention to other art forms.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: weekly one-hour sessions with the instructor and a fellow student. Every other week the student will write and present orally a 5
to 6-page paper on the assigned readings for that week. On alternate weeks the student will write and present a 2-page critique of the fellow student's paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to majors in Comparative Literature.

COMP 243(S) (formerly 252) Modern Women Writers and the City (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 252)
Ambivalence has always been a vital part of literary responses to city life. Whether they praise the city or blame it, women writers react to the urban environment
in a significantly different way from men. While male writers have often emphasized alienation and strangeness, women writers have celebrated the mobility and
public life of the city as liberating. We will look at issues of women's work, class politics, sexual freedom or restriction, rituals of consumption, the conservation of
memory by architecture, and community-building in cities like London, New York, Berlin, Paris. We will examine novels and short stories about the modern city
by writers as diverse as Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, Anzia Yezierska, Ann Petry, Jean Rhys, Marguerite Duras, Margaret Drabble Ntozake Shange, Verena
Stefan and Jhumpa Lahiri and Edwidge Danticat. We will consider theoretical approaches to urban spaces by feminists (Beatriz Colomina, Elizabeth Wilson),
architectural historians (Christine Boyer) and anthropologists and sociologists (Janet Abu-Lughod, David Sibley, Michael Sorkin). Several contemporary films
will be discussed. All readings in English.
Format: lecture and discussion. Requirements: two short papers and one final paper.
Prerequisites: Comparative Literature 111 or a 100-level English course. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20).

In this tutorial, we will read five novels written between 1850 and 1899, all of which focus on the figure of the adulteress: Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet
Letter (1850), Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1856), Lev Tolstoy's Anna Karenina (1873-77), Theodor Fontane's Effi Briest (1894), and Kate Chopin's The
Awakening (1899). For each week of class, students will read one of these primary texts, as well as a selection of secondary literature that will allow us to under-
stand, over the course of the semester, how and why the adulteress played a key role in the cultural imagination of Europe and the United States during this time.
Students will meet with the professor in pairs, with one student from each pair writing a 5-page paper for each class session. All works not originally written in
English will be read in English translation.

This course will present some of the methodologies and issues involved in studying the literature of the American hemisphere, with particular emphasis on the
dialogue between US and Spanish American writers in the 19th century. Then as now, some of Latin America's most important intellectuals were profoundly
affected by the experience of living in the US, and their influential formulations of Latin American identity reflect their ambivalence towards the northern neigh-
bor that was both enviously successful and alarmingly imperialistic with regard to the rest of the hemisphere. Reading Domingo F. Sarmiento, Jos Mart, and
other Spanish American authors in dialogue with Emerson, Whitman and the like, we will examine the various and intertwined ways in which American writers
from both North and South of the Ro Grande addressed questions of fundamental importance to the new nations of the Americas, including the legacies of
slavery and colonial violence, the scope of democracy and women's participation in it, the link between geography and national identity, and the nature of inter-
American relations. This course fulfills the EDI requirement by challenging students to engage in a comparative study of the US and Latin American societies,
focusing on the ways that political events and decisions in the US have affected Latin American lives and the ways that Latin American writers (and their audi-
ences) have viewed the US. Conducted in English.

COMP 308 Everyday Life in Literature and Film (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
To bring the all too familiar everyday to our attention, artists and writers have made it strange. What happens when we view everyday life from elsewhere? While
everyday culture has often been experienced as repressive and alienating in modern Western societies, a new importance assigned to everyday life made it liberat-
ing in Japan during the twenties and in contemporary China. The contours of the everyday are delightfully vague, and it always exceeds theorizing. For instance,
is its privileged place the street or the home? Is it lived largely in institutions that regulate our daily lives, or is it lived between and outside them? Everyday objects
and commodities like the potato, the postcard, the car, clothes, housing, etc., will be analyzed. Fiction by Leo Tolstoy, Franz Kafka, Georges Perec, Manil Suri, Ha
Jin, and Banana Yoshimoto. Films by Chantal Akerman, Pedro Almodovar, Benoit Jaquot, and Pierre Jeunet. Art projects that transform the everyday will also be
discussed, including those of Sophie Calle, Mary Kelley, Mierle Laderman Ukeles, and Christine Hill. Short theoretical excerpts from Freud, Kracauer, Goffman,
Lefebvre, de Beauvoir, Friedan, Debord, Foucault, and Bourdieu. All works not originally in English will be read in English translation.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on two short oral reports on everyday objects and their history, two 3- to 5-page papers, and a 10- to 12-page final paper

Foreign relations between the United States and China, particularly on the level of culture, have emerged as a vital, if poorly understood, topic in recent years. This
course attempts to historicize this interest by exploring a period of intense US-Sino cultural exchange from the turn of the 20th century to the start of the Cold War.
We begin from the perspective of cultural comparison: how did major American and Chinese authors respectively understand their place in the world? How did
they define and narrate issues such as industrialism, populism, and modernity? How did they perceive their Chinese or American "Other," and develop new
cultural forms to represent these perspectives? In this section we will read major texts by (US) John Dos Passos, Frank Norris, Ezra Pound, Amy Lowell, Jack
London, and (China) Lu Xun, Shen Congwen, Mao Dun, Zhou Zuoren, Yu Dafu. Then, we proceed from an angle of cultural connection by exploring authors
who directly engaged and experienced both cultures, often building bridges between the two. How did American writers in China use their time abroad to chal-
lenge their own culture, and vice versa? What types of bonds did US and Chinese writers develop during this period? How did contact and collaboration between
these authors lead to new forms of literature and social critique? In this section, we will read cultural works by (US) Pearl Buck, Agnes Smedley, Edgar Snow,
W.H. Auden, and (China) Lin Yutang, Lao She, Hu Shi, Zhang Ailing. Overall, the goal of this course will be to gain a better understanding of our current moment
of US-Sino contact by examining a period in which most of our present ideas of the "Other" took shape and crystallized. No reading knowledge of Chinese is
required; all readings in Chinese will be offered in English translation.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, weekly response papers, and one final research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Preference given to students majoring in Comparative Literature or Literary Studies and who have pre-
viously studied Chinese.

COMP 312(F) Global English/Global Chinese: Cultural Contexts (Same as Chinese 312)
How did English become the world's most powerful spoken language? How did Chinese become the world's most commonly spoken language? Will Chinese
supplant English as the world's lingua franca? What is the relationship between the rise of English and the rise of Chinese as global languages? What is the
relationship between the political and social power of a language, and its prevalence across the world? This course attempts to offer some answers to these
questions by reading a number of important modern American, British, and Chinese cultural and literary texts that explore issues of language, power, and the
political. We will specifically examine four contexts: late 19th century American literature such as Huck Finn and A Hazard of New Fortunes that debate the idea
of English as a national language versus English as a cosmopolitan language; British colonial literary texts of the early 20th century such as Kim and Passage to
India that posit the idea of a global English; Chinese cultural texts from the mid-20th century that address the issue of Chinese as a potential "world" language and
its relationship (and resistance) to English as a dominant language; and finally, our present moment in which English and Chinese have begun to intermix in a
number of new and transnational cultural and media forms, such as novels by Timothy Mo and installations by Shu Bing. Ultimately, this course asks, how do
languages become powerful on a global scale, and what language(s) will become most common and influential in the 21st century?
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class, one short paper, and one long paper.

COMP 340(F) Literature and Psychoanalysis (Same as English 363) (W)
The British psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott once wrote: "It is a joy to be hidden, and a disaster not to be found." This course will explore the many ways in which
writing enacts this paradox, examining in the process several main strands of psychoanalytic thought in relation to literature that precedes, accompanies, and
follows them in history, and experimenting with our own writing. Approximately the first two-thirds of the course will involve close readings of theoretical and
literary texts, which will be shared in a seminar format. In the latter portion of the course, students will work with each other and with the instructor on analyzing
the processes of reading and writing as they produce original psychoanalytic readings of texts of their choice. All readings in English.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active engagement with the material and with each other; reading journal; the equivalent of two shorter and one longer

COMP 346 Questioning the Cultural Self in Literature (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
Cultural encounters entail a questioning of identity, values and worldview. As the familiar gives way to the unknown, issues of knowledge and power can begin to
influence the interaction between different groups. In this course we will examine texts dealing with differences in language, religion, race, class, gender and
citizenship that lead to the formation of allegiances and rivalries. What constitutes a cultural group? How is difference determined? What is the nature of the
103
tension characteristic of many a cross-cultural encounter? How do cultural hybridity and conflicting solidarities influence multi-cultural dialogues? Readings for
this course include Jhumpa Lahiri's The Namesake, Nelida Pinon's The Republic of Dreams, Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Jamaica Kincaid's A Small
Place, Ghassan Kanafani's Return to Haifa and Victor Martinez's Parrot in the Oven: Mi Vida.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, two 3- to 5-page papers and a final 7- to 10-page paper.

This course will consider different kinds of works (poetry, memoirs, fiction, essay) written by authors forced to live in exile as a consequence of political and/or
religious persecution. Our point of departure will be the paradigmatic expulsion and subsequent diaspora of the Jews of Spain and Portugal. Most assignments,
however, will be drawn from twentieth century texts written during, or in the wake of, the massive destruction and displacements brought about by the Spanish
Civil War and World War II. How is the life lost portrayed? How are the concepts of home and the past intertwined? What kind of life or literature are possible for
the deracinated survivor? We will discuss the role of writing and remembrance in relation to political history, as well as in the context of individual survival.
Readings might include works by Nuez de Reinoso, Len, Cernuda, Semprn, Benjamin, Nancy, and Blanchot.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, an oral presentation, several short writing assignments, a midterm paper and a final

COMP 401(F) Senior Seminar: Literature and the Law (Same as English 449 and Legal Studies 399)
In this seminar, we will examine the complex relationship between literature and the law from three different perspectives. First, we will look at the law as a genre
of literature by reading several works of legal writing, such as the Code of Hammurabi, sections of the Old Testament, and the Constitution of the United States.
Second, we will read literary and visual works that rely on legal practice, forensic analysis, or trial procedure to structure their narrative, including Aeschylus'
Oresteia, Kafka's The Trial, Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, and Court TV. Third, we will integrate our study of these two by reading theory by Freud,
Derrida, Foucault, and others, on the cultural significance of the law, as well as the co-evolution of legal consciousness and literary craft. All readings in English.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on thoughtful and timely preparation for class, several shorter writing assignments, and a final research project.

COMP 401 Senior Seminar. Sublime Confusion: A Survey of Critical Theory (Same as English 370) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered
2010-2011)
What does it mean to have a theory of literature? Can something as vital, as varied, and as vague as art or fiction ever be reduced to anything like a science? We
will investigate these questions with a survey of art and literary theory that takes up a cross section of texts from classical times to the present. We will focus
particular attention on the aesthetic quality called "the sublime"--a category that has often been constituted in opposition to "beauty" to express the power and the
attraction of art that is not beautiful, but whose frightening, confusing, even threatening aspect is somehow thrilling or appealing. This idea interested early critics
from the classical rhetorician pseudo-Longinus to the German Idealists, as a way to make aesthetics more scientific paradoxically by identifying the doorway
through which art and literature escaped the realm of reason. More recently the notion of literature's thrilling confusion has played a key role in modern literary
theory from Russian formalism to New Criticism, deconstruction, and postmodernism. (In fact, poststructuralist criticism itself has a thrillingly confusing quality
that we will not ignore.) The class will focus on careful reading of relatively short texts by Plato, pseudo-Longinus, Burke, Kant, Schiller, Shklovsky, Eichen-
baum, I.A. Richards, Barthes, Derrida, Lyotard, and others. We will find and discuss illustrations drawn from literature, visual media, and contemporary culture.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, short writing assignments, a polished oral presentation, and a final 15-page paper.
Prerequisites: a course in critical (art or literary) theory or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Priority will be given to seniors
majoring in Comparative Literature, Literary Studies, or a related discipline, and those with a demonstrated interest in critical theory.

MCGUIRE*. Visiting Assistant Professor: RAGHAVAN.
Computers and computation are pervasive in our society. They play enormously important roles in areas as diverse as education, science, business, and the arts.
Understanding the nature of computation and exploring the great potential of computers are the goals of the discipline of computer science. A sample of the areas
of research investigated by the Williams Department of Computer Science alone illustrates the vast range of topics that are of interest to computer scientists and
computing professionals today. This includes: the use of computer-generated graphic images in the arts and as a tool for visualization in the sciences and other
areas; the protocols that make transmission of information over the Internet possible, the design of revolutionary new computer languages that simplify the
process of constructing complex programs for computers; the development of machine learning algorithms that can extract useful and even novel information
from data that is too complex for humans to analyze; algorithms that can solve problems that were previously too hard to solve in a reasonable amount of time, just
by giving up a little bit of optimality in the solution; the investigation of machine architectures and specific hardware aimed at making computing fast.
The department recognizes that students' interests in computer science will vary widely. The department attempts to meet these varying interests through: (1)
the major; (2) a selection of courses intended for those who are interested primarily in an introduction to computer science; (3) recommended course sequences
for the non-major who wants a more extensive introduction to computer science in general or who seeks to develop some specific expertise in computing for
application in some other discipline.
MAJOR
The goal of the major is to provide an understanding of algorithmic problem solving as well as the conceptual organization of computers and complex pro-
grams running on them. Emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles of computer science, building upon the mathematical and theoretical ideas underlying
these principles. The introductory and core courses build a broad and solid base for understanding computer science. The more advanced courses allow students
to sample a variety of specialized areas including graphics, artificial intelligence, computer architecture, networks, compiler design, and operating systems. Inde-
pendent study and honors work provide opportunities for students to study and conduct research on topics of special interest.
The major in Computer Science equips students to pursue a wide variety of career opportunities. It can be used as preparation for a career in computing, for
graduate school, or to provide important background and techniques for the student whose future career will extend outside of computer science.

Two or more electives (bringing the total number of Computer Science courses to at least 8) chosen from 300- or 400-level courses in Computer Science. At
least one of these must be a course designated as a PROJECT COURSE. Computer Science courses with 9 as the middle digit (reading, research, and thesis
courses) will normally not be used to satisfy the elective requirements. Students may petition the department to waive this restriction with good reason.
Required Courses in Mathematics
Mathematics 251 Discrete Mathematics
and any other Mathematics course at the 200-level or higher
Students considering pursuing a major in Computer Science are urged to take Computer Science 134 and to begin satisfying their mathematics requirements
early. Note in particular that Discrete Mathematics covers material complementing that in the introductory courses (Computer Science 134 and 136) and is a
prerequisite for many advanced courses.
Students who take Computer Science 107, 108 or 109 may use that course as one of the two electives required for the major in Computer Science. Those who
count Computer Science 109 toward the major must select an elective different from Computer Science 371 (Computer Graphics) for their project course. Simi-
larly, students who count Computer Science 108 as an elective cannot select Computer Science 373 as their project course. Computer Science 107, 108, 109, and
134 are not open to students who have taken a Computer Science course numbered 136 or higher.
To be eligible for admission to the major, a student must normally have completed Computer Science 136 as well as Discrete Mathematics by the end of the
sophomore year. A second Mathematics course at the 200-level or higher must be completed by the end of the junior year. Students are urged to have completed
two of the four core courses (Computer Science 237, 256, 334, and 361) by the end of the sophomore year and must normally have completed at least three out of
the four core courses by the end of the junior year.
Satisfactory participation is required in the Computer Science Colloquium by all senior majors. With the advance permission of the department, two appropri-
ate mathematics courses numbered 240 or above may be substituted for one Computer Science elective. Other variations in the required courses, adapting the
requirements to the special needs and interests of the individual student, may be arranged in consultation with the department.
Potential majors are strongly encouraged to look at the latest copy of the Informal Guide to Computer Science, which can be obtained on the World Wide Web
at http://www.cs.williams.edu. This document contains much more information on the major, including suggested patterns of course selection and advice on
courses relevant to different student goals.
LABORATORY FACILITIES
The Computer Science Department maintains two departmental computer laboratories for students taking Computer Science courses, as well as a lab that can
be configured for teaching specialized topics such as robotics. The workstations in these laboratories also support student and faculty research in computer sci-
ence.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
The degree with honors in Computer Science is awarded to a student who has demonstrated outstanding intellectual achievement in a program of study which
extends beyond the requirements of the regular major. The principal considerations in recommending a student for the degree with honors will be: mastery of core
material, ability to pursue independent study of computer science, originality in methods of investigation, and creativity in research. Honors study is highly
recommended for those students with strong academic records in computer science who wish to attend graduate school, pursue high-level industrial positions in
computing, or who would simply like to experience research in computer science.
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of registration in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of
the junior year to arrange a program of study that could lead to the degree with honors. Such a program normally consists of Computer Science 493 and 494 and a
WSP of independent research under the guidance of a Computer Science faculty member, culminating in a thesis which is judged acceptable by the department.
The program produces a significant piece of written work and often includes a major computer program. All honors candidates are required to give an oral
presentation of their research in the Computer Science Colloquium in early spring semester.
Students considering honors work should obtain permission from the department before registering in the fall of the senior year. Formal admission to candida-
cy occurs at the beginning of the spring semester of the senior year and is based on promising performance in the fall semester and winter study units of honors
work. Recommendations for the degree with honors will be made for outstanding performance in the three honors courses. Highest honors will be recommended
for students who have displayed exceptional ability, achievement, or originality.
INTRODUCTORY COURSES
The department offers a choice of four introductory courses--Computer Science 107: Strategy, Interaction, and Design in Board and Video Games, 108:
Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, 109: The Art and Science of Computer Graphics, and Computer Science 134: Introduction to Computer Science.
Computer Science 134 provides an introduction to computer science with a focus on developing computer programming skills. These skills are essential to
most upper-level courses in the department. As a result, Computer Science 134 together with Computer Science 136 are required as a prerequisite to most ad-
vanced courses in the department. Those students intending to take several Computer Science courses are urged to take 134 early.
Those students interested in learning more about exciting new ideas in computer science, but not necessarily interested in developing extensive programming
skills, should consider Computer Science 107: Strategy, Interaction, and Design in Board and Video Games, 108: Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality, or
109: The Art and Science of Computer Graphics.
105
Students with significant programming experience should consider electing Computer Science 136 (see "Advanced Placement" below). Students are always
welcome to contact a member of the department for guidance in selecting a first course.
STUDY ABROAD
Study abroad can be a wonderful experience. Students who hope to take computer science courses while abroad should discuss their plans in advance with the
chair of the department. Students who plan to study away but do not expect to take courses toward the major should work with the department to create a plan to
ensure that they will be able to complete the major. While study abroad is generally not an impediment to completing the major, students should be aware that
certain computer science courses must be taken in a particular sequence and that not all courses are offered every semester (or every year). Students who wish to
discuss their plans are invited to meet with any of the faculty in Computer Science.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
Students with an extensive background in computer science are urged to take the Advanced Placement Examination in Computer Science. A score of 4 or
better on the exam is normally required for advanced placement in Computer Science 136.
Students who wish to be placed in Computer Science 136 but who have not taken the Advanced Placement Examination should consult with the department.
Such students should have had a good course in computer science using a structured language such as Java.
PLANS OF STUDY FOR NON-MAJORS
The faculty in Computer Science believes that students can substantially enrich their academic experience by completing a coherent plan of study in one or
more disciplines outside of their majors. With this in mind, we have attempted to provide students majoring in other departments with options in our department's
curriculum ranging from two-course sequences to collections of courses equivalent to what would constitute a minor at institutions that recognize such a con-
centration. Students interested in designing such a plan of study are invited to discuss their plans in detail with a member of the faculty.To assiststudents making
such plans, we include some suggestions below.
Students seeking to develop an extensive knowledge of computer science without majoring in the department are encouraged to use the major requirements as
a guide. In particular, the four core courses required of majors are intended to provide a broad knowledge of topics underlying all of computer science. Students
seeking a concentration in Computer Science are urged to complete at least two of these courses followed by one of our upper-level electives. Such a program
would typically require the completion of a total of five Computer Science courses and one course in discrete mathematics.
There are several sequences of courses appropriate for those primarily interested in developing skills in programming for use in other areas. For general pro-
gramming, Computer Science 134 followed by 136 and 237 will provide students with a strong background in algorithm and data structure design together with
an understanding of issues of correctness and efficiency. Students of the Bioinformatics program are encouraged to take Computer Science 134 at a minimum,
and should consider Computer Science 136 and 256. The sequence of courses Computer Science 109 and 134 would provide sufficient competence in computer
graphics for many students interested in applying such knowledge either in the arts or sciences. For students requiring more expertise in the techniques of comput-
er graphics, Computer Science 136 and 371 could be added to form a four-course sequence.
There are,ofcourse,manyotheralternatives.Weencourage interestedstudentstoconsultwiththe department chair or other members ofthedepartment'sfacul-

GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All Computer Science courses may be used to satisfy the Division III distribution requirement.
Alternate Year Courses
Computer Science 107, 108, 109, 315, 336T, 337T, 339, 356T, 371, 373, 374T, 432, and 434T are each normally offered every other year. All other Computer
Science courses are normally offered every year.
Course Numbering
The increase from 100, through 200 and 300, to 400 indicates in most instances an increasing level of maturity in the subject that is expected of students.
Within a series, numeric order does not indicate the relative level of difficulty of courses. Rather, the middle digit of the course number (particularly in upper-level
courses) generally indicates the area of computer science covered by the course.
Course Descriptions
Brief descriptions of the courses in Computer Science can be found below. More detailed information on the offerings in the department is available in the
Informal Guide to Computer Science.
Courses Open on a Pass-Fail Basis
Students taking a Computer Science course on a pass-fail basis must meet all the requirements set for students taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken pass-fail, though courses graded with the pass-fail option may not
be used to satisfy any of the major or honors requirements. However, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the department beyond those
requirements may be taken on a pass-fail basis.
CSCI 107 Strategy, Interaction, and Design in Board and Video Games (Same as ArtS 107) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered
2010-2011)
A game is an aperture on strategic thought and interaction. The ideas behind board games, puzzles, and video games find applications in economics, business,
biology, psychology, and politics. Games are also art. They literally contain graphic, sculptural, and industrial design. They are beautiful mathematical constructs.
Games are an interactive medium that communicates that which is inaccessible through passive forms. Underlying disciplines as diverse as biology and art are
deep, shared ideas: of a space containing design, decision, and constraints; of computation and process; and of the ultimate limits on reason and efficiency. This
course reveals a surprising name for those deep ideas: computer science. This multidisciplinary course explores games and their serious applications through
design exercises and game playing. Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation, analysis assignments, and a significant final project. For the project, you
will work in a group to design a new game using both traditional art media and software like Photoshop, following the principles discussed in class. Along the
way you will develop an intuitive grasp of computer science concepts including heuristics, minimax, and emergence.
Format: seminar and studio. Lab fee.
No prerequisites. No programming or game experience is assumed. This course is not open to students who have completed Computer Science 136 or above.
Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16) Preference given to first-year students.
MCGUIRE
CSCI 108(F) Artificial Intelligence: Image and Reality (Q)
Over 50 years ago, scientists began to envision a world where computers and humans could converse. In 1956 the field of "Artificial Intelligence" was officially
born, and the work on "AI" began in earnest. Walking and talking robots are still mostly the stuff of science fiction, but AI is close to making them reality. In this
course, we will explore the field of Artificial Intelligence. We will try to answer the question "what makes a machine intelligent?" Among the systems we will
explore in lecture will be game-playing systems, systems that learn from their environments, and systems that create plans for complex tasks. Underlying all the
topics addressed in this course will be two fundamental issues: How can information be represented in a computer so that the machine is able to make use of it?
How can the system manipulate that information so that it is able to perform a task that requires intelligence? This course will emphasize hands-on laboratory
experience. Laboratory projects will focus on the building and programming of simple robots.
Format: lecture/laboratory. Evaluation will be based on weekly laboratory assignments, four problem sets, short papers, and a final examination having similar
format to the problem sets.
This course does not assume any programming experience. This course is not open to students who have successfully completed a Computer Science course
numbered 136 or above. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 18). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.

CONTRACT MAJOR
Contract Major Advisor: CHARLES R. TOOMAJIAN, Jr.
Students with the talent and energy for working independently and with the strong support of two faculty advisors may undertake a Contract Major: a coherent
study of an interdisciplinary subject not covered by a regularly offered major. Such a major must be in an area suitable to the talents of the faculty in residence and
cannot consist of minor modifications to an existing major. A Contract Major also must conform to the structure and have the coherence of a departmental or
program major--i.e., it must embody a disciplined cumulative study that moves from an elementary to an advanced level and culminates in a synthesis similar to
a senior major course. Hence a Contract Major usually consists of a program of existing courses, sometimes supplemented by courses of independent study and
the senior course.
The process of constructing a proposal for a Contract Major is both interesting and demanding. As part of that process, students should consider carefully the
advantage of working within existing majors or programs, taking note of the considerable intellectual pleasures involved in sharing similar educational experi-
ences with other students working within the same field. Students might also consider whether their interests could be met by completing a regular major and
coordinate program, or two majors, or simply by working outside a major field in courses of special interest. Because the Contract Major represents an exception-
al opportunity provided for students whose interests cannot be met through existing departmental and interdepartmental majors and programs, it cannot be pur-
sued in conjunction with another major.
Students who wish to explore or propose a Contract Major should consult with the Contract Major Advisor and with potential faculty sponsors as early as
possible in the fall semester of the sophomore year, and then--during the sophomore year--follow these procedures:
1) The student must initiate discussion with at least two members of the faculty from differing departments who expect to be in residence during the student's
senior year and who are willing to endorse the Contract Major and undertake a central role in supervising its implementation, criticism, evaluation, and ultimate
validation. Since in essence faculty sponsors substitute for the student's major department, they are expected to play an important role in the Contract Major.
The student must develop, in conjunction with the faculty sponsors, a written proposal (forms and guidelines are available in the Registrar's Office) which
should contain:
a) a description of the proposed major area of study and an explanation of the reasons for proposing the Contract Major. A sound and persuasive
rationale for the major is crucial for obtaining approval from the Committee on Educational Policy (C.E.P.).
b) a list of all courses in the proposed major and an explanation for each course choice. A minimum of nine semester courses, one of which must be
designated the senior major course (and taken during the senior year), must be completed for a Contract Major. Normal rules governing course
grades and grade point average apply for entry into and continuation in a Contract Major.
c) a list of other courses taken or anticipated to meet College distribution requirements, including grades received in courses already completed.
2) By mid-January, the student must meet with the Contract Major Advisor to discuss and further develop the proposal.
3) By the first day of spring semester classes, the student must submit a complete draft of the proposal to the Contract Major Advisor for feedback.
4) By the end of the fourth week of the spring semester, the student must submit the final proposal to the Contract Major Advisor. By this date also, the faculty
sponsors must submit their endorsement forms to the Contract Major Advisor. If the student is essentially proposing to transform an existing coordinate program
(e.g., Africana Studies, area studies programs, Environmental Studies), into a Contract Major, the chair of that program should also submit to the Contract Major
Advisor a statement attesting to the validity of the proposal by the end of the fourth week of the spring semester.
5) The Contract Major Advisor then conveys the proposal, a copy of the student's most recent academic progress report, the faculty sponsors' endorsement
forms, and recommendations regarding the feasibility and substance of the proposal, for approval by the Committee on Educational Policy. The C.E.P., after
consultation with departments and programs substantially affected by a proposal, will vote on each proposal individually and will notify students and sponsors
before the spring registration deadline. If the time needed for C.E.P. review demands it, the Contract Major Advisor may permit them to register late without
penalty. In making its decisions, the C.E.P. considers the student's academic record, the coherence and feasibility of the plan of study, and the degree of support
expressed by the faculty sponsors and, if appropriate, program chairs.
Subsequent changes in a Contract Major must be requested in writing by the student and approved by the faculty sponsors as well as by the Contract Major
Advisor. Where there has been substantial alteration of the original program, the Contract Major Advisor will forward the student's written request to the C.E.P.
for reconsideration.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THE CONTRACT MAJOR
The route to the degree with honors in the Contract Major will normally be a senior thesis requiring two semesters and a winter study of work. In special
circumstances a student may propose to substitute a one-semester course or a winter study course for one of his or her thesis courses and write a mini-thesis. The
Contract Major with honors shall comprise a minimum of eleven semester courses or ten semester courses plus one winter study. One semester of independent
study undertaken for the thesis may be allowed to fulfill the requirement for a senior major course.
The faculty sponsors shall determine by the end of winter study whether the student is to be admitted to honors candidacy. If not admitted to honors candidacy,
the student may elect not to continue further independent study. If admitted to honors candidacy, the student shall submit a written thesis or minithesis to three
faculty readers, at least one of whom shall be a faculty sponsor and at least one of whom shall not be a faculty sponsor. The outside reader or readers shall be
selected by the Contract Major Advisor in consultation with the faculty sponsors. There will be a one-hour oral exam by the readers, and they shall make a final
decision regarding honors.

CRITICAL LANGUAGES (Div. I)
Coordinator, JANE CANOVA
The Critical Languages Program enables students to study important foreign languages not taught in regular courses at Williams. Hebrew, Hindi, Korean, and
Swahili can be studied for one year at the elementary level.
Students work independently with standard language textbooks and individual cassette tapes for roughly ten hours per week and attend two one-hour group
review sessions per week with native-speaking tutors. Language faculty from other institutions conduct the midterm and final exams and determine the final
grades.
To be eligible for a 200-level Critical Languages course, the student must:
z
demonstrate proven capability for independent work and previous success in foreign language study;
z
explain how study of the language will integrate with his or her major or other academic interests;
z
present a letter of recommendation from a Williams faculty member;
z
in some cases take a pretest for placement;
z
have attained sophomore standing or higher;
z
have at least a 3.00 Grade Point Average.
Interested students should obtain an application form for the desired course in early April. Forms are available at the Center for Foreign Languages, Literatures,
and Cultures in the North Academic Building. Students must meet with the program coordinator and hand in the completed application forms no later than one
week before preregistration. The application must be approved before registering for the course.
Students should note that Critical Languages courses are hyphenated, meaning no credit is given for the first semester until the second semester is successfully
completed. Students must normally begin a course in the fall semester. It cannot be taken Pass/Fail.
A Critical Languages course will be scheduled only if and when at least two students are accepted into the course. Students planning to register for the course
must attend an organizational meeting the first week of each semester.
CRHE 201(F)-202(S) Hebrew
This course is part of the Jewish Studies concentration.
CRHI 201(F)-202(S) Hindi
CRKO 201(F)-202(S) Korean
CRSW 201(F)-202(S) Swahili

Faculty: Assistant Professor: BURTON. Lecturer: H. SILVA. Visiting Lecturer: DANKMEYER. Ballet Mistress: PARKER. Musical Director/Ac-
companist: SAUER. Musical Director/Kusika: TBA.
The purpose of the Dance Department is to educate students in the physical disciplines, cultural traditions and expressive possibilities of dance. We provide the
opportunity to study and experience dance as technique, composition, history, theory and performance. We do not offer a major or a concentration yet our courses
can offer complementary study in the disciplines of Theater, Visual Art, Africana Studies, Performance Studies and Music. Technique courses currently offered
include ballet, modern, African and Irish traditions and Pilates.
Some courses may be taken for Physical Education and/or academic credit. Successful participation in a company provides completion of the college physical
education requirement. Students may take class at a beginner or at the intermediate/advanced level as indicated by the course description. There is no placement
audition for classes. If you are not certain about your level please contact the instructor.
All students are welcomed to audition for membership in the Department's performing companies (Dance Company, Kusika, Sankofa, and INISH). Member-
ship is also possible through invitation by the company directors, and student members receive Physical Education credit for completing company requirements.
Kusika and INISH also accept members as dancers, musicians, singers and storytellers. Members study with faculty, guest artists and peers. Student choreogra-
phers are also supported.
The Department belongs to and attends the American College Dance Festival Association New England Regional where students are able to perform, attend
master classes and audition for scholarships for summer study. Our students also participate in area cultural events and provide workshops, lecture demonstrations
and performances for local schools.

COURSES WHICH MAY BE TAKEN FOR ACADEMIC CREDIT ONLY
DANC 212(S) Prelude to Revolt: The Life and Work of Martha Graham
The revolutionary dance work of Martha Graham (1894-1991) has been compared to the artistic innovations of Picasso and the musical genius of Stravinsky. The
study of Graham's development within the American cultural climate of the last century, including her influence on the dancers and actors she trained, and her
collaborations with musicians and artists, informs our understanding of the modern performance culture of today.
This course will be comprised of two elements: 1) Historic Evolution: an overview of modern dance from its roots in 1900 to the present, we will focus on the
development of Graham's dance theory from her days with Denishawn to her later years, while also studying the work of her contemporaries, and her influence
111
on artists who studied with her. 2) Dance Technique: an intensive introduction to major principles of the Graham Technique as a tool for the development of the
performer in any medium.
Format: studio and seminar. Evaluation for the course will be based on completion and quality of each of the requirements, including term paper, performance
critique paper, practicum exam, discussion of reading and video assignments, and active, committed participation in technique. Students will perform a final
showing/lecture demonstration at the end of the term.

ECONOMICS (Div. II)
Chair, Professor STEPHEN SHEPPARD
Professors: BRADBURD, CAPRIO**, D. GOLLIN*, HUSBANDS FEALING**, KUTTNER, MONTIEL, S. SHEPPARD, SWAMY, ZIMMER-
MAN. Associate Professors: BAKIJA, GENTRY, P. PEDRONI, RAI, SCHMIDT, SHORE-SHEPPARD. Assistant Professors: ASHRAF, GAZ-
ZALE, LALUMIA, LOVE, NAFZIGER*, ROLLEIGH, SAVASER*, WATSON, WILSON. Senior Lecturer: SAMSON. Visiting Professor:
TRUMAN. Visiting Associate Professor: HONDERICH. Visiting Assistant Professor: KONISHI.
The primary objectives of the economics major are to develop an understanding of economic aspects of contemporary life and to equip the student to under-
stand and analyze economic issues of social policy. The introductory courses stress use of the basic elements of economic analysis for understanding and resolv-
ing such issues. The two required intermediate theory courses then provide a more thorough grounding in economics as a discipline by examining the strengths
and weaknesses of the market in allocating economic resources and by examining the aggregate processes that determine employment, inflation, and growth. A
course in statistical methods, either Economics 255 or alternatively, Statistics 201 plus Statistics 346 equips the major to understand and apply the tools of quanti-
tative empirical analysis in measuring and testing economic theory. In elective courses students apply theoretical tools and empirical techniques to develop a
richer understanding of economic behavior and public policy.
Graduate training in economics requires more mathematical sophistication than does undergraduate economics. We encourage students who are considering
pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics to take Mathematics 105 (or 106), Mathematics 209, Mathematics 211 and Mathematics 301. If available, students should also
consider electives such as Economics 454 and 475 that present an advanced perspective on contemporary economic theory. As graduate schools also look for
evidence of research experience and promise, we strongly encourage interested students to write a senior honors thesis in Economics.
Should I Major in Economics to Prepare for a Career in Business?
Economics is a social science that deals with how individuals and organizations make choices, and with the allocation of scarce resources among competing
ends. An economics major is excellent preparation for a wide variety of careers: public policy, law, teaching, economics research in government or in the private
sector, as well as more general careers in business. Training in economics is similar to training in other sciences: you will learn about economic systems and the
relationships between economic agents and the constraints that determine these relationships. You will learn about economic data and how to test economic
theories and measure economic outcomes. Training in economics is not the same as training in business management. Success in business is achieved by students
from a wide variety of majors, not only economics. We advise students to acquire a broad exposure to the arts, social sciences and natural sciences, and to major in
the subject that most engages their interest, rather than attempt to acquire extensive pre-professional training while undergraduates.
MAJOR
Students who have not yet taken an economics course should begin their sequence with Economics 110 and should follow the following se-
quence:
Economics 110 Principles of Microeconomics
(Note that students may not take any economics courses, including Economics 110 and 120, without having passed the quantitative studies exam or the
equivalent.)
Economics 120 Principles of Macroeconomics (Economics 110 or the equivalent is a prerequisite for 120)
Economics 251 Price and Allocation Theory
Economics 252 Macroeconomics
Economics 255 Empirical Methods
Please note that Statistics 101 or 201 is a prerequisite from Economics 255. Students who are considering majoring in economics are thus
strongly encouraged to take Statistics 101 or 201 early in their college careers. Students may take the combination of Statistics 201 and 346
instead of Economics 255. Economics 253 cannot be substituted for Economics 255.
Note that Economics 251, 252, and the Empirical Methods course can be taken in any order. In most cases all three of these courses are pre-
requisites for Economics Senior Seminars, at least one of which is required for the major. Senior seminars are typically taken during senior
year or during the spring of junior year. Students are thus strongly encouraged to complete these three core courses by the end of junior year
at the latest.
Prospective majors please note that instructors in all sections of Economics 251, 252, and 255 and courses numbered 350 and above feel free to use elementary
calculus in assigned readings, lectures, problem sets, and examinations; therefore, Economics 110 and 120 and Mathematics 103 or its equivalent are required as
prerequisites for these courses, with the exception of 251 which has only Economics 110 and Mathematics 103 as prerequisites. By elementary calculus is meant
differentiation of single variable polynomial functions and conditions for a maximum or minimum; it does not include integration. Students are also reminded that
some courses now have specific mathematics requirements; see course descriptions.
Elective Requirements:
Students must complete four Economics electives, of which at least two must be selected from advanced electives numbered 350 to 394 (or from the
CDE courses offered), and one of which must be selected from electives numbered 450-475. (Note: students may substitute an extra 450+ elective for a
350-394 elective. However, in admitting students to these courses, the department will give preference to students who have not yet taken a course
numbered 450-475.)
Credit for Coursework Done Elsewhere
The normal requirement that nine economics courses be taken at Williams will usually be waived only on the basis of transferred credit deemed acceptable by
the department. Credit is granted based on grades consistent with college policy on various examinations:
z
Students who receive a 5 on the Microeconomics AP or Macroeconomics AP exam, or a 5 on each, may place out of Economics 110 or 120, or both,
respectively, but major credit will be given for only one course.
z
The Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a student who receives a 6 or 7 on the higher-level Economics IB examina-
tion, and that student can place into any 200-level course or intermediate-level micro or macro course.
z
For A levels credit, the Department will grant major credit for both Economics 110 and 120 to a student who receives a grade of A or B.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who are considering study abroad should consult with the Department's Coordinator for Transfers/Study Abroad Credits early in the process of
planning a year or semester abroad. (See the Department website to determine which professor is the Coordinator for this academic year.) Economics majors or
prospective majors who are considering spending all or part of their junior year abroad are strongly advised to choose sophomore courses such that they can
complete their intermediate theory requirements (Economics 251, 252, and 255) prior to the start of their senior year. We recommend as well that students com-
plete at least part of the major's advanced elective requirement prior to the beginning of the senior year. Students who hope to pursue Honors in economics but
who plan to be away for all or part of the junior year are strongly advised to meet with the Department's Director of Research prior to going abroad to discuss
options for pursuing honors. (See the Department website to determine the Director of Research for this academic year.)
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ECONOMICS
We encourage all majors who have at least a 3.5 GPA in economics courses to consider honors. To be admitted to candidacy for honors in economics a student
must complete a substantial piece of independent research. Two routes to honors are open: the Specialization Route and the Thesis Route.
1) Specialization Route, consisting of these three units:
a. Development of a thesis proposal;
b. An honors winter study project (W30) in January of the senior year;
c. Economics 491 or 492 Honors Seminar. Students may pursue the Specialization Route to honors in their senior year, either in the fall semester plus WSP
or WSP plus the spring semester. After selecting an advisor and discussing the topic with the advisor, the student should submit a thesis proposal to the
department for approval. (A description of what should be included in proposals is listed on the department's website.) Such proposals frequently build on
research papers completed for advanced electives, but this is not a requirement. Students should submit proposals at the end of the spring semester if they
wish to pursue a fall-WSP thesis, and by one week after the last day of classes in December if they wish to pursue a WSP-spring thesis. The department
provides a memorandum to majors with more details every spring and fall.
2) Thesis Route (Economics 493-W30-494):
A few students each year will be accepted for year-long thesis research on a subject closely related to the scholarly interests of a faculty member. A student
who hopes to do such independent and advanced research in close association with a faculty member should begin to work out a mutually satisfactory topic
113
early in the second semester of his or her junior year. Application to the department must be made before the end of the junior year by submitting a detailed
proposal for work under the supervision of the faculty member. The WSP of the senior year is also spent on the thesis.
TheCollege Bulletin states that students who wish to receive honors must take at least one course in addition to the minimum number required for the major.
Students who pursue a year-long thesis and therefore take both Economics 493 and 494 may substitute Economics 493 for an upper-level elective (excluding
those numbered 400-490) if they wish to. Students who pursue the Specialization Route to Honors may not substitute Economics 491 or 492 for an upper-
(or lower-) level elective requirement.
Because economics honors theses frequently make use of empirical economic methods, students considering writing an honors thesis in economics are strong-
ly advised to complete Economics 255 or Statistics 346 before the end of junior year.
AFRICANA STUDIES AND AREA STUDIES
A major in economics who concentrates in Africana Studies or Area Studies may substitute the non-economics courses in the concentration for one lower-lev-
el elective in the Economics major, but not for an advanced elective (350-394).
Note on course numbers: Courses between 201 and 299 are lower-level electives and are open to students who have taken 110 or 120. Courses 350 and
above are advanced electives, have intermediate theory prerequisites, and are primarily designed for Economics and Political Economy majors. Courses
numbered 450-475 are only open to students who have completed Economics 251, Economics 252, and who have satisfied the statistical methods re-
quirement unless the course prerequisite explicitly indicates otherwise.
ECON 110(F,S) Principles of Microeconomics (Q)
This course is an introduction to the study of the forces of supply and demand that determine prices and the allocation of resources in markets for goods and
services, markets for labor, and markets for natural resources. The focus is on how and why markets work, why they may fail to work, and the policy implications
of both their successes and failures. The course focuses on developing the basic tools of microeconomic analysis and then applying those tools to topics of popular
or policy interest such as minimum wage legislation, pollution control, competition policy, international trade policy, discrimination, tax policy, and the role of
government in a market economy. This course is required of Economics and Political Economy majors and highly recommended for those non-majors interested
in Environmental Studies and Women's and Gender Studies. The department recommends that students follow this course with Principles of Macroeconomics or
with a lower-level elective that has Economics 110 as its prerequisite. Students may alternatively proceed directly to Intermediate Microeconomics after taking
this introductory course.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, quizzes, short essays, midterm, final exam.

ECON 111(S) Introduction to Economics and Its Applications (Q)
This course is intended for students who do not wish to major in economics but who would like to learn something about the discipline and to develop a greater
understanding of the ways in which economics can be used to explain behavior and to inform policy. Our focus will be on providing some very basic tools of
economic analysis and important institutional background regarding the US and international economies, and then using those tools and institutional knowledge
to analyze current policy issues.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, several short papers, at least one quiz, and midterm and final exam.
Prerequisites: open only to juniors and seniors who have not taken an economics course. (Note: Economics 111 cannot substitute for Economics 110 or Econom-
ics 120 as a prerequisite for admission to Economics 251 or Economics 252, respectively.) Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30).

ECON 120(F,S) Principles of Macroeconomics (Q)
An introduction to the study of the aggregate national economy. Develops the basic theories of macroeconomics and applies them to topics of current interest.
Explores issues such as: the causes of inflation, unemployment, recessions, and depressions; the role of government fiscal and monetary policy in stabilizing the
economy; the determinants of long-run economic growth; the long- and short-run effects of taxes, budget deficits, and other government policies on the national
economy; and the workings of exchange rates and international finance.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, short essays, midterm(s), final exam.

ECON 203 Gender and Economics (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 203) (Not offered 2009-2010)
This course uses economic analysis to explore how gender differences can lead to differences in economic outcomes, in both households and the labor market.
Questions to be covered include: How does the family function as an economic unit? How do individuals allocate time between the labor market and the house-
hold? How have changes in family structure affected women's employment, and vice-versa? What are possible explanations for gender differences in labor force
participation, occupational choice, and earnings? What is the role of government in addressing gender issues in the home and the workplace? How successful are
government policies that primarily affect women (e.g., comparable worth policies, AFDC/TANF, subsidization of child care)? The course will focus on the
current experience of women in the United States, but will place these gender differences in a historical and cross-cultural context.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: weekly discussion papers, two midterms, and a final paper and presentation.
Prerequisites: Economics 110. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 25).

development, as well as competing theories of economic growth. The majority of the course will examine the main topics in the microeconomics of development
including fertility, human capital investments, labor and land markets, savings/insurance, community-based institutions, and migration. In addition, we will ex-
plore the role of the state in economic development, the relationship between development and international trade, and the relationship between development and
the environment.

ECON 205(F) Public Economics
This course examines the role of the government in a market economy. Three broad issues are considered: when is government intervention in the economy
appropriate? What is the most effective form of intervention? What effects do government policies have on individual incentives? The course will cover issues in
both taxation and spending. Specific programs will be considered such as Social Security, Medicare, education, and public assistance for the poor. We will also
discuss rationales and strategies for reforming the U.S. tax system.

ECON 207(F) The Economics of HIV/AIDS (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 207)
To fully understand how and why the AIDS pandemic is occurring, and how best to respond to it, we need economic tools. And conversely, thinking carefully
about HIV/AIDS can change how we think about economics. In this class we will discuss what features of an economy could make a population particularly
susceptible to infection with HIV, and what the economic impact of a largescale epidemic is. Then we will look at economic issues involved in response to the
pandemic, including the tools and critiques of cost effectiveness; the development and pricing of treatment; and the political economy of North/South aid. Particu-
lar attention will be paid to gender, and the issue of care labor.
Requirements: Two short papers and a research paper. Participation in class discussion will count for part of the grade.

ECON 209 Labor Economics (Not offered 2009-2010)
This course covers basic labor markets and the determination of wages in the U.S. The determination of wages and employment levels through demand and
supply of labor in competitive and non-competitive markets is the basis for analyzing the wide range of outcomes we observe in the U.S. Differences in earnings
and employment are analyzed through a variety of mechanisms such as labor force participation, the role of unions, human capital accumulation and occupational
choices. Topics with important public policy implications such as discrimination and affirmative action, minimum wages, and immigration will also be presented.

ECON 211 Gender in the Global Economy (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 211) (Not offered 2009-2010)
This course will present a feminist economic analysis of the global economy, and some of the urgent issues facing women in poor countries. The course will start
by developing theoretical resources: these will include feminist critiques of economics theory, work on care labor and the shifting boundaries between markets,
governments and households, theories of household bargaining, and discussions of difference. Then we will discuss a series of interlinked issues including: the
contradictory effects of structural adjustment and its successors; the informal sector and the `invisible assembly line'; the economics of sex work and global sex
trafficking; migration and reproductive labor; microcredit; the economics of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We will finish by looking at community-based activism,
non-governmental organizations, and the possibilities for first-world/third-world alliances.
Requirements: midterm exam, research paper. Participation in class discussion will count for part of the grade.

ECON 213 The Economics of Natural Resource Use (Same as Environmental Studies 213) (Not offered 2009-2010) (Q)
Markets for natural resources continue to make news--whether the issue is oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or management of tropical rainfo-
rests. Economic theory helps predict how individuals and firms will respond to incentives in their use of natural resources. Sometimes market incentives lead to
outcomes that are socially desirable; sometimes they do not. This class will focus on three specific questions: What forces are generated by markets for different
types of resources? When do markets work well, and when do they work poorly? How do different kinds of public actions affect market outcomes? We will
consider both renewable and non-renewable resources, including land, water, fisheries, minerals, and forests. Along the way, we will also address different types
of management problems--including issues relating to multiple uses and open access. The class will draw on relatively simple tools, beginning with supply and
demand analysis, but extending to some more complicated dynamic models. We will make use of spreadsheet software to work out numerical examples of some
models. These numerical examples will serve as a basis for discussing real-world problems and experiences, including both international and domestic examples.
We will particularly consider some of the resource management issues facing developing countries.

ECON 219T Global Economic History (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
Why did Western Europe--and not China, India, or the Middle East--first experience the Industrial Revolution? Why did Latin America fall behind in the 20th
century? Why have the countries of East Asia recently experienced such high rates of economic growth? And why has Africa remained so poor for so long?
These and other questions will guide our exploration of world economic development over the past several millennia. We will draw on micro and macroeconomic
theory to help explain and interpret the historical roots of the modern global economy. Our focus will be broadly comparative across space and time, with an
emphasis on how institutions, resource endowments, cultural and technological revolutions, and market developments have driven economic changes.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: will meet weekly for one hour in groups of two. Evaluation will be based on five 5- to 7-page papers, critiques of fellow students'
papers, a longer revision of a paper, and engagement in discussion.

ECON 222(S) Economics of the Arts and Culture
What economic forces influence the creation, presentation, preservation and ownership of art and culture? Should support for the arts be provided through private
patronage, private philanthropy, or public sector support? How does the mechanism of support for art affect the productivity and creativity of the artist? Does art
make a good investment for an individual? How do art markets function and what determines the price of art? Why do some art museums and performing arts
organizations require donations and public support and operate as non-profit enterprises, while other types of culture production and preservation operate as
for-profit enterprise? What are the impacts on economic vitality and local economic development of cultural and arts organizations? When these impacts arise,
how can (or should) they be used for public policy? This course will use the tools of economic analysis to present a framework for discussion and analysis of these
and related questions.
Format: lecture, discussion. Requirements: midterm and final exam, two policy memoranda.

ECON 225T(S) Global Financial Crisis and African Economic Development (W)
Will the global financial crunch create a development crisis for Africa? Just two years ago the International Monetary Fund published the most optimistic growth
projections for Africa in decades, predicting rapid growth driven by higher commodity prices, stronger agricultural output and the dividends of years of difficult
economic reforms. Today, economic analysts are downgrading African growth forecasts in the face of growing poverty and macroeconomic challenges. Food
prices have more than doubled in some countries ncreasing hunger for the most vulnerable groups. Fuel costs nd subsidy policies in some countries re
creating macroeconomic imbalances, and the global financial crisis is depressing demand for Africa xports. Private capital flows, which reached record levels
until 2007, are expected to decline by $300-400 billion over the next two years, with bank lending falling, portfolio investment declining, and foreign direct
investment decreasing. This triple-F crisis ood, fuel and financial s posing renewed challenges to African leaders trying to tackle the imperatives of economic
development and pro-poor and inclusive economic growth. This crisis is raising the costs of reforms in countries reliant on exports and international capital for
growth. Successful strategies must combine policies more efficiently than ever o balance the necessary reforms with initiatives that offset the costs for the most
vulnerable. This tutorial will analyze critical questions posed by the emerging crisis: Which countries will be hit the hardest, and how deeply and for how long?
Through which channels does the contagion afflict national economies? And perhaps most importantly, what coordinated strategies can African nations develop
in order to foster effective responses? This tutorial will explore how policy-makers in Africa are working to build successful inclusive growth strategies, with
fiscal, monetary, industrial, trade and labor market policies reinforcing each other rather than working at cross purposes.
Format: tutorial, will meet weekly for one hour in groups of two. Evaluation will be based on five short papers and on the quality of the student's oral presentations
and commentary on the work of his/her colleagues.

ECON 228T(S) Water as a Scarce Resource (Same as Environmental Studies 228) (W)
This course satisfies the "Environmental Policy" requirement for the Environmental Studies concentration.
For a variety of reasons including environmental pollution, urbanization, changing agricultural techniques, resource mismanagement, and the consequences of
climate change, water is becoming a scarce resource even in places where it was relatively plentiful in the past, and it is likely to become an increasingly scarce
115
resource over the coming decades. In this course we will use basic economic models to consider policy issues relating to water: Is access to water a basic human
right, and if so, what market and non-market mechanisms should play a role in water allocation? Does public ownership of water improve the way it is provided
and used? Why do societies differ in their approaches to allocating water and are some systems better than others? What does it mean to have a property right to
water? Could private property rights to water help address the water pollution problem? How can societies change their water-related property rights, regulations
and social institutions when individuals have implicit or explicit rights to the institutional status quo? Who has the right to water that crosses international bound-
aries? How should societies allocate water across generations?
Format: tutorial. Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Requirements: write a 5- to 7-page paper every other week (five in all),
prepare and present a written critique of their partners' papers in alternate weeks, and revise and re-write one of their five papers. Evaluation will be based on the
quality of the papers and on the quality of the student's oral presentations and commentary on the work of his/her colleagues.

ECON 229(S) Law and Economics (Q)
This course applies the tools of microeconomic analysis to both private (i.e., civil) and criminal law. This analysis has both positive and normative aspects. The
positive aspects deal with how individuals respond to the incentives created by the legal system. Examples include: how intellectual property law encourages the
creation of knowledge while simultaneously restricting the dissemination of intellectual property; how tort law motivates doctors to avoid malpractice suits; and
how criminal law deters criminal activity. The normative aspects of the analysis ask whether legal rules enhance economic efficiency (or, more broadly, social
welfare). Examples include: what legal rules are most appropriate for mitigating pollution, ensuring safe driving, and guaranteeing workplace safety? The course
will also cover the economics of legal systems; for example, what are the incentives for plaintiffs to initiate lawsuits and what role do lawyers play in determining
outcomes. The course will also consider potential reforms of the legal system.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, problem sets, short papers based on actual court cases and possible legal reforms, a
midterm exam, and a final exam.
Prerequisite: Economics 110. Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 25). Preference given to majors and sophomores if overenrolled.

ECON 230 The Economics of Health and Health Care (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
In recent years, the intersection between health and economics has increased in importance. The costs of health care have been rising, seemingly inexorably. A
substantial fraction of the United States population lacks health insurance, while the rising number of elderly is putting increasing pressure on health spending.
Globally, the HIV/AIDS pandemic is causing severe economic hardship, and many people lack access to basic health care. More positively, advances in health
care have widened the scope of possible treatments. Given the importance of good health for individual well-being, it is not surprising that health care and how to
pay for it are of concern to individuals and policymakers worldwide. In this course we will analyze the economics of health by applying standard microeconomic
techniques to the problems of health and health care markets. The course focuses on three broad issues: the inputs to health and the demand for health care, the
structure and consequences of public and private health insurance, and the supply of health care. Special attention will be devoted to topics of current public
policy, including the problems of rising costs and cost containment, health insurance reform, the changing nature of health care provision, changing public poli-
cies in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, hospital competition, and the determinants and consequences of technological change in medicine.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: several short papers, a research paper, and a final exam.
Prerequisite: Economics 110. Enrollment limited to 19 (expected: 19).

ECON 235 Urban Centers and Urban Systems (Not offered 2009-2010) (Q)
Cities, systems of cities, and the interactions between cities are the outcome of human decisions and reflect their social structure and desire for interaction. The
form of these urban areas is determined by the choices made by the people who reside in, work in, and travel between cities. Economic forces influence and
constrain these choices, and economic models of decision-making can help us to explain and predict the patterns that result. These models help us to comprehend
the structure of urban areas. This course will introduce the ideas and some of the analytic tools that assist in understanding the economic foundations of urban
centers and urban systems. Topics addressed in the course will include the determinants of land use, location of firms, choice of transportation mode, flows of
capital investment into real estate, housing prices and housing availability and regulation of housing markets, movement of population from one city to another,
and public policies designed to deal with urban problems.

ECON 240T Colonialism and Underdevelopment in South Asia (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
How did colonialism shape the evolution of the economies of South Asia? There is much controversy on this issue, beginning with whether the colonial economy
really represented a radical break from the past. With this as our starting point, we will discuss major themes in this literature including the theory of "drain" (of
economic surplus from the colonies),"deindustrialization" due to competition from cheap British manufactured goods, the impact of colonial legal institutions
and land tenure arrangements, and colonial policies with respect to education, infrastructure, trade, and financial markets. The course will conclude with an
assessment of the extent to which the economies of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh still reflect their colonial past, and the consequences thereof.

ECON 253(F) Empirical Methods in Political Economy (Same as Political Economy 253) (Q)
This course introduces students to common empirical tools used in policy analysis and implementation. The broad aim is to train students to be discriminating
consumers of public policy-relevant research. The emphasis in the course is on intuitive understanding of the central concepts. Through hands-on work with data
and critical assessment of existing empirical social scientific research, students will develop the ability to choose and employ the appropriate tool for a particular
research problem, and to understand the limitations of the techniques. Topics to be covered include basic principles of probability; random variables and distribu-
tions; statistical estimation, inference and hypothesis testing; and modeling using multiple regression, with a particular focus on understanding whether and how
relationships between variables can be determined to be causal-an essential requirement for effective policy formation. Throughout the course, the focus will be
on public policy applications relevant to the fields of political science, sociology, and public health, as well as to economics.
Format: lecture and discussion. Requirements: problem sets, group projects, short essays, and three quizzes.

ECON 351(F) Tax Policy (Q) (W)
The tax system is a major element of public policy. In addition to raising revenue for government expenditure programs, policymakers use the tax system to
redistribute resources and to promote a variety of economic policies. For example, the United States tax system has specific rules to encourage savings, education,
and investment. Inherently, many tax policy choices involve trade-offs between equity and efficiency. The purpose of this course is to clarify the goals and possi-
bilities of tax policy, mainly through an examination of U.S. federal tax policy (though the search for possible reforms may lead us to examine policies from other
countries). The course will examine the choice of the tax base (income or consumption), notations of fairness in taxation (e.g., the rate structure), the choice to tax
corporate income separately from personal income, and a variety of specific tax policy issues (e.g., retirement saving, child care, the "marriage" tax, capital gains
taxation, and the taxation of housing).
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: several shorter papers, a research paper, and final exam.

Recent national initiatives and legislative statutes on competitiveness, including the America COMPETES Act, encourage the development of an infrastructure
that promotes innovation and competitiveness in the public and private sectors. Yet the organization of our markets and institutions will in part determine the
success of such initiatives. The purpose of this course is to examine how current regulatory structure promotes or impedes economic competitiveness. The effica-
cy of government policies in promoting the competitiveness of industries in local and global markets will be examined in this course. We will focus on a broad
spectrum of regulations and regulatory reforms that have affected the transportation, telecommunications, electricity, pharmaceutical, and information technology
sectors, as well as policies that have had significant impacts on financial markets, intellectual property rights and the environmental policy. We will also consider
the implications of market and regulatory failures.

ECON 353 Decision Theory (Not offered 2009-2010) (Q)
Studies of decision-making suggest that most people substantially violate even undemanding models of rationality. Are people truly irrational, and, if so, can
anything be done about it? This course focuses on normative decision-making (how we should make decisions under general conditions), descriptive decision-
making (how we do make decisions under actual conditions), and the contrast between the two. We proceed to a view of prescriptive decision-making, or how we
might combine normative and descriptive insights to improve decision-making and judgment. Topics include decision-analytic methods for improving decision-
making rigor (e.g., decision trees); microeconomic concepts and tools for optimization problems; game theory as appropriate; insights from cognitive psychology
on heuristics (short cuts) that sometimes help, but often distort, decision-making; integrated models of judgment that call for both analysis and intuition; insights
from the newly-emerging studies of judgment and wisdom. Until a few years ago, this topic was given normative treatment in departments of engineering,
statistics and economics, and was separately taught as a descriptive science in departments of psychology. The apparent value of combining the two into a single,
prescriptive analysis of decision-making and judgment has led to a recent wave of interdisciplinary approaches such as the one adopted in this course.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: multiple problems and case analyses, one project, final exam.

loosely structured around three questions: a) How ought income be distributed? b) How is income distributed? c) What policies should be considered when a) and
b) differ? The first question moves us into the area of ethics. We will spend several classes discussing the connections between economic analysis and ethical
theory. The second question moves us into the area of facts and theories surrounding income distribution. The third question moves us to consider policy re-
sponses to any perceived problems. In considering question c) we will focus on issues related to the distribution of income and status in the United States.

Since 1965, the annual poverty rate in the United States has hovered between 10 and 15 percent, though far more than 15 percent of Americans experience
poverty at some point in their lives. In this course, we will study public policies that, explicitly or implicitly, have as a goal improving the well-being of the poor in
this country. These policies include safety net programs (Aid to Families with Dependent Children/Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, Food Stamps,
Medicaid, and housing assistance), education programs (Head Start and public primary and secondary education), and parts of the tax code (the Earned Income
Tax Credit). We will explore the design and functioning of these programs, focusing on questions economists typically ask when evaluating public policy: Does
the policy achieve its goals? Does the design of the policy lead to unintended effects (either good or bad)? Could it be redesigned to achieve its goals in a more
cost-effective manner? Through in-depth study of these programs, students will learn how economists bring theoretical models and empirical evidence to bear on
important questions of public policy.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on six 5- to 7-page papers and on the quality of the student's oral presentations and commentary on the work of his/her
colleagues.
Prerequisites: Economics 253 or 255 or Statistics 346 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to majors if overen-
rolled.

ECON 375T Speculative Attacks and Currency Crises (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
This course will review the causes and consequences of currency crises in industrial countries and emerging economies. Topics to be covered include analytical
models of balance of payments crises, empirical research on the determinants of currency crises, the relationship between currency and banking crises, and the
channels of "contagion" of crises across countries. The evolution of a series of important recent crises with systemic implications will be examined, including the
European crisis of 1992, the Mexican crisis of 1994, the Asian crisis in 1997, and the Russian crisis of 1998. Several more recent currency crises with effects more
restricted to the crisis countries themselves will also be studied.

ECON 378(S) Long-Run Perspectives on Economic Growth (Q)
The world today is marred by vast inequities, with about a hundred-fold difference in per capita income from the poorest country to the most affluent. Similar
differences exist between rates of growth in different countries. What explanations do economists have to offer for these differences in levels of prosperity and
rates of growth? Are the explanations to be found in underlying differences between countries during the past few decades? The past few centuries? Or the past
few millennia? If modern differences in economic affluence have origins that are hundreds or thousands of years in the past, what scope exists for policies to
reduce global inequality? Can we expect these inequalities to be reduced gradually over time through natural economic processes, or are they likely to persist
unless action is taken to reduce them? This course will present a unified theory of economic growth for thinking about these and related questions, along with a
review of the evidence that has been examined by scholars and is emerging concerning the applicability of the theory. Examples of issues to be covered include,
amongst other topics, the importance of human capital formation in the process of industrialization, the role of colonialism, slavery and ethnic fractionalization in
shaping modern institutions, and the long-lasting effect of geography through its impact on the emergence of agriculture in early human societies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements will include at least one exam, a research paper and a class presentation.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 and 252 or permission of the instructor, familiarity with econometrics will be helpful but not essential. Enrollment limit: 25 (ex-

ECON 383 Cities, Regions and the Economy (Not offered 2009-2010)
Cities and urbanization can have significant impacts on the economy. In many developed economies, a process of regional decline is associated with older,
industrial cities. In developing countries, the process of economic growth is generally associated with increasing urbanization. Urbanization, with its increasing
concentration of population and production, puts particular pressure on markets to allocate resources for provision of land, housing, transportation, labor and
public goods. Urbanization can alter the productivity of land, labor, and capital in ways that can improve the welfare of residents and the performance of the
broader economy. In this course we will examine these conflicting economic forces and examine some recent research that contributes to our understanding of the
difference between regional growth and decline, and the role that the urban structure plays in these processes. We will examine the function of land, housing,
transportation, and labor markets in the urban context, and the scope for public policies to improve the performance of the regional economy.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two midterms and a research paper.
Prerequisites: Economics 251. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25). Preference given to seniors and juniors.

ECON 394 European Economic History (Not offered 2009-2010)
Why did modern economic growth first occur in Europe, and not in China or the Middle East? Why did the Industrial Revolution occur in Britain and not France?
Why did the economy of the Soviet Union collapse in the 1980s? What drove European economic integration? This course will explore these and other questions
related to the economic development of Europe from the early modern period until today. We will investigate how institutional change, technology, industrializa-
tion, social welfare policies, trade and globalization, and government intervention have affected the process of economic growth. Drawing on a wide variety of
empirical and theoretical readings, the perspective of the course will be comparative, both across Europe and to the experiences of developing countries today.

ECON 395T(F) Growth and Sustainability (W)
The question to be addressed in this class is whether material living standards can continue to rise indefinitely: is "sustainable growth" possible, or is the world
doomed to stagnation--or eventual collapse--by limited resources, population pressures and pollution? The readings will include the views of pessimists, such
as Malthus and Diamond, as well as those of optimists, such as Simon and Nordhaus. Because growth and the allocation of resources are central to the study of
economics, we will confront the question of sustainability with the tools of microeconomics and growth theory, extending standard economic models to address
the challenges posed by population growth, resource use, and pollution.
Format: tutorial; will meet weekly for one hour in groups of two. The requirements are five 5- to 7-page papers, written commentary on fellow students' papers,
an expanded version of one of the short papers and consistent contributions to tutorial discussions.

ECON 451 The Macroeconomics of National Saving (Not offered 2009-2010)
This seminar provides a detailed examination of topics related to the macroeconomics of national saving (which is the sum of household, corporate, and govern-
ment saving). Topics include theoretical and empirical analyses of the effects of budget deficits on economic growth; general-equilibrium effects of taxation and
government spending; the efficacy of tax-favored saving vehicles, such as 401(k) plans, in promoting national saving and welfare; the effects of national saving
on capital accumulation and labor supply; and the intergenerational consequences of deficits and debt. The emphasis in this seminar will be on quantifying the
importance of these topics using a combination of econometrics and numerical models. Students will have an opportunity to apply these methods in a required
end-of-term research paper.
Format: seminar. Requirements: midterm, final, class participation and research paper.

ECON 452T Economics of Community Development (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
This course focuses attention on the economic issues that arise in understanding community development. Students will address such questions as: why do some
cities grow, while others lose population? Why are some communities successful in attracting new firms and getting existing ones to expand? Why are some
communities regarded as offering better `quality of life' than others? Why do employees of local governments join unions in higher proportions than any other
sector of the economy? How do decisions made in local governments affect the overall economy, and how does the economy and competition between commu-
nities affect local decisions? Thinking about such questions helps to develop skills in economic analysis and understanding of communities, the challenges they
confront, and how to improve them. Students will be expected to read, discuss, and synthesize a variety of analytic approaches into their own analysis of particular
community development questions. Students will be expected to work with and analyze data and to present the results of their analysis.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week; they will write a paper every other week, and comment on
their partner's papers every other week.

ECON 454 Topics in Macroeconomics (Not offered 2009-2010)
This seminar explores some of the central topics in macroeconomics, including economic growth, saving and investment, business cycle fluctuations, monetary
policy, and financial crises. The first part of the course focuses on long-run economic growth. Using economic theory and evidence, we will attempt to answer
some of the most important questions in all of economics: Why are some countries poor and other countries rich? What can governments do to achieve faster and
119
environmentally sustainable rates of growth? What are the growth consequences of sustained budget deficits? Understanding the behavior of the economy in the
long run is one of the key tasks of macroeconomics. But as we have seen during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the short run matters as well. In the second part of
the class, we will turn our attention to economic downturns and financial crises. Using historical work on past crises and the accumulating evidence on the current
one, we will study a host of short-run topics, including financial markets, the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies, consumer expectations, asset prices,
employment, and productivity. Because this is an advanced class in macroeconomics, we will approach these issues as practicing economists working with the
best possible models and empirical techniques. Students will have an opportunity to apply these methods in a required end-of-term research paper.
Format: seminar. Requirements: midterm, final, class participation and research paper.

ECON 456 Income Distribution (Not offered 2009-2010)
This course examines the distribution of income in the U.S., with particular emphasis on how it is affected by taxes, transfers, and other government programs.
Most of the course will focus on the bottom of the income distribution, where the role for policy is greatest. Questions to be addressed may include the following:
What are the causes and consequences of poverty? How do welfare, the minimum wage, and the EITC affect those in poverty? How does discrimination affect
the incomes of various demographic groups? What are the effects of affirmative action? How much mobility is there across the income distribution? What ex-
plains the recent growth in income at the top of the distribution, and the resulting increase in inequality?
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: short writing assignments, computer lab exercises, oral presentations, and a final research paper.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 and 253 or 255 or equivalent. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference: senior Economics majors.

ECON 457(S) Public Economics Research Seminar
In this class, students will learn how to read, critically evaluate, and begin to produce economic research on important and interesting public policy questions.
Topics will be selected from across the spectrum of public economics issues and may vary from year to year. Examples of specific topics that may be covered
include education, taxation, income inequality, privatization, Social Security, saving behavior, labor supply, anti-poverty policy, health care policy, fiscal policy,
political economy, and the economics of crime and corruption (we will typically only cover a subset of these topics). Applications will be drawn from both the
United States and other industrialized or developing countries. The course will especially emphasize the critical analysis of empirical evidence on public policy
questions. This course would be ideal preparation for seniors (or juniors, if offered in the spring) interested in writing an economics thesis, of for students who
would like to get a taste of the kind of original empirical research one would do for a thesis without actually having to commit to a thesis.
Format: a mix of lecture, seminar discussion, and time in a computer lab and in individual meetings learning to work with data and estimate econometric models .
Requirements will include a 15- to 20-page research paper (written in stages) that is a combination of a research proposal and an original empirical analysis of
data, a series of short papers and empirical exercises, and regular constructive contributions to class discussion.
Prerequisites: Economics 255, Economics 251, and Economics 120. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference will be given to senior Economics majors.

ECON 458T(F) Economics of Risk
Risk and uncertainty are pervasive features of economic decisions and outcomes. Individuals face risk about health status and future job prospects. For a firm,
developing new products is risky; furthermore, once a product has been developed, the firm faces product liability risk if it turns out to be unsafe. Investment
decisions - from managing a portfolio to starting a business - are also fraught with uncertainty. Some risks are environmental - both manmade problems and
natural disasters; other risks include the possibility of terrorist attack and, more locally, issues of campus safety. This tutorial explores both the private market
responses to risk (e.g., financial markets, insurance markets, private contracting, and precautionary investments and saving) and government policies towards risk
(e.g., regulation, taxation, and the legal system). From a theoretical standpoint, the course will build on expected utility theory, diversification, options valuation,
principal-agent models, contract theory, and cost-benefit analysis. We will apply these tools to a wide variety of economic issues such as the ones listed above.
One goal of the course is to discover common themes across the disparate topics. Students will be expected to read and synthesize a variety of approaches to risk
and uncertainty and apply them to various issues.
Format: tutorial; will meet with the instructor in pairs in each week.
Requirements: each student will write a paper (or do a short project) every other week, and comment on his or her partner's work in the other weeks. The final two
weeks will be reserved for applied projects of the student's choice. One of the papers during the term will be revised to reflect feedback from the instructor and the
student's partner.
Prerequisites: Economics 251, 252, and Economics 253 or 255. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference to senior majors.

ECON 459 Economics of Institutions (Not offered 2009-2010)
Why are some countries rich and others poor? There are numerous candidate explanations emphasizing factors ranging from demography to technological in-
novation to unequal international relations. However, some economists like Douglass North and Mancur Olson have argued that beneath the profusion of proxi-
mate causes the quality of a country's "institutions" fundamentally determines its economic prospects. The word "institutions" is used broadly; it can refer to
micro-structures like households or macro-structures like the state. The course will survey the literature on institutions and economic development, discussing
both developed and developing countries. Readings will largely consist of published journal articles and unpublished work of similar quality. Students should
expect to use microeconomic theory and econometrics learned in previous courses.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on four short papers of 7-10 pages each.
Prerequisites: Economics 251, Economics 253 or 255 or the equivalent; students who have already taken Economics 502 will not be admitted. Enrollment limit:

ECON 461 Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Modeling (Same as Economics 504) (Not offered 2009-2010)
The Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is an important tool for applied policy work. CGE models are the primary tool for many government organi-
zations when evaluating policy alternatives and are also used extensively by various NGO's when deciding aid and policy recommendations. The great advantage
of these models is that they capture the general equilibrium feedback effects of policy proposals on various sectors of the economy. This is of great importance to
applied work, as this allows the identification of the winners and losers from potential policies. The class will begin with a general overview of CGE models. This
overview will be rigorous and mathematical. This course will use the free programming packages GAMS and MPSGE to implement various CGE models using
real world data. While no previous computer experience is required, some familiarity with at least one programming language is recommended. During the latter
part of the course, students will create a CGE model for a country of their choice and conduct policy experiments using their model. Interested students could
continue this project as a potential thesis topic.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, two midterms, final project and presentation.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105, Economics 251. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference will be given to senior Economics majors.

ECON 463(S) Financial History
This course opens with a brief survey of some of the major characteristics, issues, and challenges of financial systems today, and then examines earlier experience
with these phenomena. Topics to be examined include: the role of finance in economic development historically; the relationship between finance and govern-
ment, and the extent to which it has changed over time; the lessons from early asset bubbles for modern financial systems; the effect of institutions (laws, norms,
and culture) and political systems in shaping the impact of finance, as illustrated by comparisons between Mexico and the U.S., among other cases; and lessons
from U.S. financial history for policies today. The course also examines the tools that were developed in earlier epochs to deal with different risks, evaluate their
efficacy, and consider lessons for modern financial regulation.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will consist either of 6 short papers or 3 short papers and one longer research paper (student choice), at least one oral presentation,
and contributions to class discussions.

ECON 464(S) Empirical Methods in Macroeconomics (Same as Economics 514) (Q)
Macroeconomics and related fields in international finance and development have evolved specialized empirical techniques, known generally as macroecono-
metrics, which are designed to meet the practical challenges that the data and the empirical questions pose in these fields. The course will introduce the theory and
application of these techniques, and students will learn how to implement these techniques using real world data to address practical questions drawn from the
fields of macro, international finance and development. Topics to which these techniques will be applied include business cycle analysis and forecasting, sources
of exchange rate volatility and determinants of long run economic growth. Computer work and programming will be an important and integral part of the course,
but no previous training is expected. Economics majors who are considering writing an honors thesis on related topics are encouraged to enroll in this course

ECON 465(F) Behavioral and Experimental Economics
Ample empirical and experimental evidence suggests significant departures from classical assumptions of economics such as perfect rationality and self-inter-
ested behavior. In this course, we review this evidence with an eye towards identifying systematic ways in which behavior deviates from our classical assump-
tions and generating new, and hopefully more realistic, assumptions of behavior. We explore the empirical, theoretical and policy implications of these findings.
Format: seminar. Requirements: one long paper, one short paper, and a series of critiques.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 and 253 or 255 or the equivalent. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference will be given to senior Economics majors. (Stu-

ECON 466 Economic Growth: Theories and Evidence (Not offered 2009-2010)
This seminar will examine recent advances in the study of economic growth. Why are some countries richer than other countries? What accounts for differences
in growth rates across countries and over time? What are the respective roles of factor accumulation and productivity growth? The answers to these questions
have important implications for policy, both in rich and poor countries, and for development assistance from rich to poor. We will review literature, including both
technical papers and more popular writing, that offer explanations linked to capital investment, human capital accumulation, policy distortions and poor institu-
tions, geography, agricultural technology, and other sources. Not only will we seek to learn the main policy messages of these papers, but also we will try to
understand why different models lead to different conclusions and how economic research progresses over time.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on either five 5- to 6-page papers or one long paper and a series of critiques, as well as class participation.
Prerequisites: Economics 251, 252, 253 or 255 or the equivalent. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference will be given to senior Economics majors.

ECON 467T(S) Development Successes (Same as Economics 518T) (W)
Although living standards in most of the worlds poor countries have increasingly fallen behind those of the rich industrial countries, a relatively small number of
countries that were quite poor in the middle of the last century have achieved dramatic improvements in their incomes since then. These development successes
include countries such as Japan, the four dragons (Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan), the MIT economies (Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand), the
Asian giants of China and India, as well as non-Asian economies as diverse as Botswana, Chile, and Turkey. This tutorial will explore why these countries have
apparently succeeded where many other poor countries have failed. A particular focus of the course will be on extracting insights from the experiences of these
success cases about the broad development strategies that have been advocated over the past 50 years by scholars as well as by the international financial institu-
tions.
Format: tutorial. Methods of evaluation; students will write five papers during the term, and will prepare and deliver formal comments on five papers written by
other students.

ECON 468(F) Your Money or Your Life: Health Disparities in the United States
A 25 year-old man living in a high-income household can expect to live 10 years longer than his low-income counterpart. There are also stark differences in
mortality and health by education, employment status, race, immigrant status, region, and gender. This course will explore many of the potential explanations for
health disparities, including access to insurance and health care, health behaviors, stress, environmental exposure, and intergenerational transmission of health.
We will emphasize causal inference and focus on assessing the quality of evidence. We will also investigate how government policies contribute to or ameliorate
health disparities in the U.S.
Format: seminar. Course will include frequent small group meetings, a computer lab, and a poverty simulation. Evaluation includes class discussion, oral presen-
tations, 4 short response papers, two 5-page critiques of published articles, and one 15-page original empirical research paper.

ECON 470(F) The Indian Economy: Development and Social Justice (D)
The Indian economy today is described in two competing narratives. India is, on the one hand, a fast-growing "emerging economy:" it is producing a range of
information technology services, threatening white-collar jobs in the United States; its growing consumption of fossil fuels is stressing world energy supplies and
contributing to global warming; along with China, it is changing the balance of international economic and political relations. In another narrative Indian econom-
ic growth is lop-sided and unsustainable: poverty and malnutrition remain widespread; Maoist insurgencies threaten a swath of eastern districts; and conflicts rage
over threatened ecological resources. In one prominent academic work India has been described as an "Emerging Giant;" in another, it is a "Republic of Hunger."
This course will introduce the student to these narratives in the words of participants, ranging from books by CEO's of major corporations to pamphlets produced
by left-wing critics of present economic policies.
We will then use the traditional theoretical and quantitative methods of an economist to evaluate these perspectives, and, consistent with the goals of the Exploring
Diversity Initiative, consider how they are shaped by power, privilege, and the social location of the narrator.
Format: seminar. Requirements: five short response papers (5 pages), and longer final paper (15 pages).

This course examines the mathematical underpinnings of advanced economics. This includes proofs of the following: existence and uniqueness of competitive
equilibrium in a variety of environments, first and second fundamental welfare theorems, existence of Nash equilibrium, and others. The focus of this class is
primarily on the mathematical proofs. These proofs are essential components of any graduate program in economics. Students who wish to see pure math theo-
rems applied to other fields may also be interested.
Format: lecture. Requirements: problem sets, two midterms, class participation, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or equivalent, Economics 251. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to senior Economics majors.

ECON 491(F)-W30 or ECON W30-492(S) Honors Seminar
This course is a research seminar for candidates for honors in economics. Each candidate prepares an honors thesis. Candidates will meet as a group to discuss
problems common to all of them (such as empirical methods, data sources, and theoretical approaches) and each one will report on his/her work at various
stages for criticism by the group as a whole. Some work is required during the preceding semester.
Prerequisites: admission by the department. Required for honors in Economics unless a student writes a year-long thesis.
ECON 493(F)-W31-494(S) Honors Thesis
A year-long research project for those honors candidates admitted to this route to honors. Prerequisites: admission by the department in the spring of the junior
year.
GRADUATE COURSES IN DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
Juniors and seniors majoring in Economics or Political Economy may, with the permission of the instructor, enroll in graduate courses given by the Center for
Development Economics (described below). Many of these courses are already cross-listed as undergraduate courses, and will count as an undergraduate elective
indicated by the cross-listed course number. Other courses might substitute for an elective in the major, but only with the permission of the chair of the department.
ECON 501(F) Development Economics I
The course examines concepts, tools, and models in contemporary economic theory that have proved relevant to development problems, and their application in
economic policymaking. Topics include growth processes and structural change; investment and sources of saving; capital, labor, and technological progress;
policies for public, private, and foreign enterprises; policymaking and negotiation in governments; and policies for reducing poverty and inequality.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: short papers, two midterms, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 and 252. Undergraduate enrollment limited and requires instructor's permission.

ECON 502(S) Institutions and Governance
Over the last two decades economists have become increasingly aware of the importance of the "social infrastructure" at various levels of economic activity:
capable and honest government officials must be available to formulate and implement policies, markets must be supported by suitable institutional frameworks,
property rights must be secure, and contracts reliably enforced. Even the structure of the household, the smallest institution analyzed by economists, has been
shown to have an important influence on economic development. This course will survey the growing literature on institutions and governance.
The class will primarily follow a discussion format. Evaluation will be based on several short papers.
Prerequisites: at least one among Economics 253, Economics 255, Economics 510, Economics 511, Statistics 346; requires permission of instructor; students
who have previously taken Economics 459 will not be enrolled. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR SWAMY
ECON 503(F) Public Economics
Public economics is the branch of economics concerned with government expenditure and taxation, focusing primarily on microeconomic aspects of these activi-
ties. It provides tools for understanding the effects of government policies, as well as a useful conceptual framework for analyzing normative questions such as
"what is a good policy?" This seminar will present the basic principles for public economics, and apply them to topics of particular importance in developing
countries. The course will begin by considering the efficiency of market economies, and rationales for government intervention in the market, such as public
goods, externalities, information-based market failures, and equity. Applications include education, health care, aid to the poor, and infrastructure. We then move
on to the economics of taxation, considering what kinds of taxes are used in developing countries and how they are designed, the economic and distributional
effects of taxation, questions of administration and evasion, and options for reform. Time permitting, we will also address topics such as pubic enterprises, politi-
cal economy, and decentralization.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: problem sets, one 5- to 7-page paper, a 15-page final paper, midterm, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Economics 251. In addition, an empirical methods course (Economics 253, 255, 510 or 511, or Statistics 346) must be taken before or concurrently
with this class. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 25-30). Undergraduate enrollment limited and requires instructor's permission.

ECON 505(S) Finance and Development
This course focuses on the financial system and its role in economic development. The first part explores the functions of finance, how it contributes to growth,
and reviews different models of financial sector development and their influence on how governments viewed the sector. It will examine experiences with finan-
cial sector repression and subsequent liberalization, and investigate the causes and impact of financial crises. Then it will study how to make finance effective and
how to prevent or minimize crises, analyzing government's role as regulator, supervisor, standard setter, contract enforcer, and owner. In this final part, attention
will be devoted to the role of institutions (laws, norms, culture) and incentives in financial sector development.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two short papers, midterm, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 and 252. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 25-30). Undergraduate enrollment limited and requires instructor's permission.

ECON 507(S) International Trade and Development
This course explores foreign exchange problems of developing countries and possible means to deal with them; evolving theories of comparative advantage and
their relevance to trade policy; strategies of import substitution and export promotion and their consequences for employment, growth, and income distribution;
foreign investment, external debt, IMF stabilization programs, and the world financial system.

ECON 509(F) Developing Country Macroeconomics
This course focuses on the relationship between macroeconomic policies and economic growth in developing countries. After examining the links between
macroeconomic stability and long-run growth, the rest of the course is divided into three parts. The first part is devoted to the construction of an analytical model
that is suitable for analyzing a wide variety of macroeconomic issues in developing countries. This model provides the general framework for a more specific
analysis of fiscal and monetary policies in the two remaining parts. In analyzing fiscal policy, the course will consider in particular the requirements of fiscal
solvency and the contribution that fiscal policy can make to macroeconomic stability. It will also examine alternative methods for achieving fiscal credibility,
including the design of fiscal institutions. The final part of the course will turn to an analysis of central banking, focusing on central bank independence, time
consistency of monetary policy, and the design of monetary policy rules in small open economies.
Format: lecture. Requirements: two hour tests and a comprehensive final exam.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 and 252. Expected enrollment: 25-30. Undergraduate enrollment limited and requires instructor's permission.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 MWF MONTIEL

ECON 513(S) Developing Country Macroeconomics II
This lecture course is a continuation of Economics 509. The first part of the course extends the analysis of the first semester to several open-economy issues that
arise in developing countries, especially with respect to the interactions among exchange rate regimes, monetary policy regimes, and policies directed at the
financial account of the balance of payments. The second part of the course will apply these analytical tools, as well as those developed in Economics 509, to an
examination of the various types of crises that have afflicted developing countries over the past three decades, considering in particular the implications of such
crises for growth and development.
Format: lecture. Requirements: two hour tests and a comprehensive final exam.

ECON 516T(S) International Financial Institutions
This tutorial will explore the role of international financial institutions in the global economic and financial system, their relations with members, and proposals
for how they might be reformed. The focus will be principally on the International Monetary Fund and to a lesser extent the World Bank, but consideration also
may be given to the regional development banks, Bank for International Settlements, the Financial Stability Forum, and the Paris Club used for official debt
renegotiations. Topics and readings will focus on such issues as: the roles and governance reform of the IMF and World Bank; relations between the two institu-
tions and their relations with other institutions of international finance and governance; lessons from their performance in international crises from the Asian
crises of 1997 through the crisis that started in 2007; and initiatives of the Fund and Bank in the global adjustment process, financial system stability (including
money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism), public and private sector governance, lending programs, the management of international reserves,
and provision of advice to members.
Tutorial meetings will be on Fridays. Participants will meet in pairs with the faculty member. Each week, one student will prepare a policy paper and submit the
122
paper to the professor and to the other student in advance of the meeting. During the meeting, the student who has written the paper will present an argument,
evidence, and conclusions. The other student will provide a detailed critique of the paper based on concepts and evidence from the readings. The professor will
join the discussion after each participant has presented and ask questions that highlight or illustrate critical points. During the semester each participant will write
and present 5 or 6 policy papers and a like number of critiques.
Enrollment will be limited to 10 students who will meet weekly on Fridays in five groups of two. Course is intended for CDE Fellows, undergraduate enrollment
limited, and only with permission of the instructor.

ECON 517(S) Tax Policy in Emerging Markets (Same as Economics 389) (Q)
Taxes are half of what government does. So if you are interested in what government policy can do to promote efficiency, equity, and economic development, you
should be interested in tax policy. Governments must raise tax revenue to finance critical public goods, address other market failures and distributional issues, and
to avoid problems with debt and inflation. Taxes typically take up anywhere from ten to fifty percent of a country's income, they profoundly affect the incentives
to undertake all varieties of economic activity, and the government expenditures that they finance have potentially large consequences for human welfare. So the
stakes involved in improving tax policy are quite large. All of these issues are of great importance in developing and transitional countries (also known as "emerg-
ing markets"), but in these nations taxation is especially challenging because of serious problems with tax evasion and administration, among other things. This
class provides an in-depth exploration of tax policy, with an emphasis on the challenges and issues most relevant in emerging markets. Topics addressed in this
class include: how basic economic principles can be applied to help one think about the efficiency and equity consequences of tax policies; how personal income
taxes, corporate income taxes, and value-added taxes are designed and administered and how they influence the economy; ideas for fundamental reforms of these
taxes; theory and evidence in the debate over progressive taxes versus "flat" taxes; how various elements of tax design affect incentives to save and invest; how
market failures may influence the optimality of different tax policies; the implications of global capital flows and corporate tax avoidance for the design of tax
policy; tax holidays and other special tax incentives for investment; empirical evidence on the influence of taxes on economic growth, foreign direct investment,
labor supply, and tax evasion; case studies of efforts to reform tax administration and reduce tax evasion and corruption; taxes on land and property; presumptive
taxation; the "unofficial" economy and its implications for tax policy; tax policy towards natural resources such as minerals and oil; taxes on imports and exports;
non-tax methods of raising revenue; and political economy considerations in tax policy.
Format: seminar. Requirements: midterm, final, problem sets, and an 8- to 10-page paper.
Prerequisites: one public economics course or microeconomics course (ECON 503 or ECON 110), and one empirical methods course (ECON 253, 255, 510,
511, or STAT 346). Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15-19). Preference given to CDE students, but undergraduates with the prerequisites are welcome.

ECON 520T(S) Inclusive Growth: The Role of Social Safety Nets
Designing and implementing effective national strategies to promote inclusive economic growth can require difficult policy reforms, sometimes with adverse
short-term impacts for vulnerable groups within society. Social safety nets provide a pro-poor policy instrument that can balance trade and labor market reform,
fiscal adjustments (such as reduced general subsidies) and other economic policies aimed at enabling better market performance. In addition, social safety nets
help the poor to cope with shocks to their livelihoods, promoting resilience, human capital development and sometimes high-return risk-taking. This tutorial will
offer students the opportunity to explore the role of social safety nets in promoting inclusive economic growth, drawing on case studies from Africa, Asia, Latin
America and Eastern Europe. The first part of the tutorial will define social safety nets within the broader context of social protection, examining the diversity of
instruments and their linkages to economic growth. The second part will delve more deeply into the design and implementation of effective interventions, assess-
ing program choice, affordability, targeting, incentives and other issues. The third part will analyze the role of social safety nets in supporting economic growth
strategies, drawing on international lessons of experience.
Format: tutorial. Methods of evaluation: students will write five papers during the term, and will prepare and deliver formal comments on five papers written by
other students.
Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

ECON 521 Urbanization and Development (Same as Economics 388 and Environmental Studies 388) (Not offered 2009-2010)
At current rates of growth, the combined population of urban areas in developing countries will double in the next 30 years. The land area devoted to urban use is
expected to double even more quickly. The costs of providing housing and infrastructure to accommodate this growth are enormous, but the costs of failing to
accommodate urban development may be even larger. The decisions made in response to these challenges will affect the economic performance of these coun-
tries and the health and welfare of the urban residents. By affecting global patterns of energy use, these decisions will have broader impacts on the entire planet.
This course will focus on these challenges. What are the economic forces that drive the process of urbanization, and how does the level of urbanization affect
economic development? How are policies towards housing, transportation, public finance and development affected by urbanization? What policy choices are
available, and which are most likely to succeed in dealing with the challenges of urban growth?
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a midterm and a final exam, plus a paper that evaluates specific problems, policy alternatives, and provides some
analysis of relevant data.
Prerequisites: Economics 251 plus 253, 255, 510 or 511. Expected enrollment: 20. Undergraduate enrollment limited and requires instructor's permission.

ECON 530(S) Research Studies
In this course, each Fellow carries out an individual research study on a topic in which he or she has particular interest, usually related to one of the three
seminars. The approach and results of the study are reported in a major paper. Research studies are analytical rather than descriptive and in nearly all cases
include quantitative analyses. Often the topic is a specific policy problem in a Fellow's own country.

COURSES AND COURSE-NUMBERING
The course offerings in English enable students, whether majors or non-majors, to explore literature in a variety of ways, and to satisfy their interests in particu-
lar authors, literary periods, and genres. They emphasize interpretive skills, systematic and critical thinking, and careful attention to the generic, cultural, and
historical contexts of literature written in English.
100-LEVEL COURSES
At the introductory level, the department offers a range of writing-intensive 100-level courses which focus on interpretive skills as well as skills in writing and
argumentation. The department also offers English 150, Expository Writing, a course focusing on analytic writing skills. All 100-level courses are designed
primarily for first-year students, although they are open to interested sophomores, juniors, and seniors. A 100-level course other than 150 is required for admission
to most upper-level English courses, except in the case of students who have placed out of the introductory courses by receiving a score of 5 on the Advanced
Placement examination in English Literature or of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate.
200-LEVEL COURSES
Most 200-level courses are designed primarily for qualified first-year students, sophomores, and junior and senior non-majors, but they are open to junior and
senior majors and count as major courses. Several 200-level courses have no prerequisites; see individual descriptions for details. 200-level Gateway courses are
designed for first- and second-year students who are considering becoming English Majors, or who are interested in pursuing upper-level course work in the
department. All Gateway courses are writing-intensive. First-year students who have placed out of the 100-level courses are encouraged to take a Gateway
course as their introduction to the department. Completion of a Gateway course is a requirement for the major.
300-LEVEL COURSES
The majority of English Department courses are at the 300 level. 300-level courses are open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors. First-year students who wish
to enroll in a 300-level course are advised to consult the instructor.
400-LEVEL COURSES
400-level courses are intensive, discussion-oriented classes that place a premium on independent, student-initiated work. Such classes can be structured in a
variety of ways. A class might culminate in a long final paper on a topic of the student's devising and involve conferences focused on the progress of that project.
A course might alternate tutorial sessions with seminar meetings, or it might take the form of a colloquium, with discussions organized around individual or group
presentations on different aspects of a topic. Limited to 15 students, 400-level courses are open to students who have completed at least one 300-level English
course; they should be attractive to any student interested in a course that emphasizes intensive discussion and independent work. Majors considering Honors
work are urged to take a 400-level course before senior year as a way of preparing for Honors work.
ADVISING
All junior and senior English majors are assigned a departmental faculty member as an advisor. Students' preferences for advisors are solicited during the
preregistration period in April, and assignments are announced at the start of the school year.
Non-majors who wish to discuss English Department offerings are invited to see any faculty member or the department chair.
MAJOR
Majors are urged to select a balance of intermediate and advanced courses, and to choose classes from the American, British and Anglophone traditions. Each
student can fashion his or her own sequence of study within a basic pattern that insures coherence and variety. This pattern comprises at least nine courses.
They are also urged to elect collateral courses in subjects such as art, music, history, comparative literature, philosophy, religion, theatre, and foreign languages
with a view to supporting and broadening their studies in literature. In particular, the study of classical and modern languages, as well as of foreign literatures, is
strongly recommended.
Requirements
The nine courses required for the major must include the following:
1) Any 100-level English class except English 150. Students exempted by the department from 100-level courses will substitute an elective course.
2) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written before 1700 (identified in parentheses at the end of the course description).
3) At least two courses dealing primarily with literature written between 1700 and 1900 (identified in parentheses at the end of the course description).
4) At least one course dealing primarily with literature written after 1900 (identified in parentheses at the end of the course description).
5) At least one "criticism" course (identified in parentheses at the end of course description). A course fulfilling the criticism requirement entails a sustained
and explicit reflection on problems of critical method, whether by engaging a range of critical approaches and their implications or by exploring a particular
method, theorist, or critic in depth. Please note that when a criticism course also deals with literature satisfying a historical distribution requirement (pre-1700,
1700-1900, etc.), the course may be used to satisfy either the criticism or the chronological requirement, but not both.
6) At least one 200-level Gateway course (listed at the end of the 200-level course descriptions). Gateway courses are designed for first- and second-year
students contemplating the major or intending to pursue more advanced work in the department; these courses focus on analytical writing skills while introducing
students to critical methods and historical approaches that will prove fruitful as they pursue the major. (Note: a Gateway course can fulfill a Period or Criticism
requirement as well as a Gateway requirement.)
The department will now give one elective course credit toward the major for a course taken in literature of a foreign language, whether the course is
taught in the original language or in translation. Such a course may not be used to satisfy the department's historical distribution, criticism, or gateway
requirements.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN ENGLISH
The English Department offers three routes toward honors: a creative writing thesis, a critical thesis, and a critical specialization. Candidates for the program
should have at least a 3.5 average in courses taken in English, but admission will not depend solely on course grades. Formal application to pursue honors must be
made to the director of honors (Chris Pye) by April of the junior year.
All routes require students to take a minimum of ten regular-semester courses (rather than the nine otherwise required for the major), and to devote their senior
year winter study course to their honors projects. All students writing a critical thesis or pursuing a critical specialization will be required to take the Honors
Colloquium in the fall semester. Students doing a creative writing thesis must, by graduation, take at least nine regular semester courses, and, in addition, take
English 497 (Honors Independent Study) and English W31 (Honors Thesis, winter
study) during senior year. Students writing a critical thesis must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester courses, and, in addition, take English 493 and
English 494 (fall Honors Colloquium and spring Honors Independent Study) and English W31 (Senior Thesis, winter study) during senior year. Students pursu-
ing a critical specialization must, by graduation, take at least eight regular-semester courses, and in addition, take English 493 and English 494 (fall Honors
Colloquium and spring Honors Independent Study) and English W30 (Honors Thesis: Specialization Route, winter study) during senior year.
Creative Writing Thesis
The creative writing thesis is a significant body of fiction or poetry completed during the fall semester and winter study of the senior year, and usually including
revised writing done in earlier semesters. (With permission of the honors committee, the thesis may be undertaken during the winter study period and the spring
semester of the senior year.) Requirements for admission include outstanding work in an introductory and an advanced workshop, a recommendation from one of
the creative writing teachers (who will then act as thesis advisor), and the approval of the departmental honors committee. A creative thesis begun in the fall is due
on the last day of winter study; one begun in winter study is due the third Monday after spring break. The methods of evaluation are identical to those for critical
projects (but their page limits do not apply).
Critical Thesis
The critical thesis is a substantial critical essay written during both semesters as well as the winter study period of the senior year. It must consider critical
and/or theoretical as well as literary texts. The thesis should be 15,000 words (45 pages); in no case should it be longer than 25,000 words. The proposal, a 3-page
description of the thesis project, should indicate the subject to be investigated and the arguments to be considered, along with a bibliography. The finished thesis is
due on the third Monday following spring break. After the critical thesis has been completed, the student publicly presents his or her work.
124
Critical Specialization
The critical specialization route is a series of forays into a broad area of interest related to work undertaken in at least two courses. At least one of these courses
must be in the English Department, and both need to have been taken by the end of fall term in senior year. The specialization route entails: (1) a set of three
10-page essays which together advance a flexibly related set of arguments; (2) an annotated bibliography (5 pages) of secondary sources, explaining their impor-
tance to the area of specialization; (3) a meeting with the three faculty evaluators (one of whom is the advisor) during the last two weeks in February to discuss the
trio of essays and the annotated bibliography; (4) a fourth essay of 12 pages, considering matters that arose during the faculty-student meeting and reflecting on
the outcome of the specialization. The 3-page proposal for the specialization should specify the area and range of the study, the issues likely to be explored, and the
methods to be used for their investigation. It should also describe the relation between previous course work and the specialization, and include a brief bibliogra-
phy of secondary works. The first two papers are due by the end of fall semester; the third paper is due at the end of winter study; the bibliography is due mid-Feb-
ruary; and the final paper is due the third Monday after spring break.
Applying to the Honors Program
All students who wish to apply to the honors program are required to consult with a prospective faculty advisor and the director of honors before April of the
junior year. Prior to preregistration in April, candidates for critical theses and specializations submit a 3-page proposal that includes an account of the proposed
project and a bibliography. Students applying to creative writing honors submit a brief proposal describing the project they wish to pursue. Decisions regarding
admission to the honors program will be made by the end of May. Admission to the honors program depends on the department's assessment of the qualifications
of the student, the feasibility of the project, and the availability of an appropriate advisor.
When pre-registering for Fall 2009, students who are applying to critical honors should register for the Honors Colloquium as one of their four courses.
Progress and Evaluation of Honors
While grades for the fall and winter study terms are deferred until both the honors project and review process are completed, students must do satisfactory work
to continue in the program. Should the student's work in the fall semester not meet this standard, the course will convert to a standard independent study (English
397), and the student will register for a regular winter study project. A student engaged in a year-long project must likewise perform satisfactorily in winter study
(English W30 or W31) to enroll in English 494 in the spring semester. When such is not the case, the winter study course will be converted to an independent
study "99."
Students are required to submit three final copies of their written work to the department on the dates applicable to the type of project pursued (see the above
descriptions of each type of project for the due dates). All honors projects are evaluated by the advisor and two other faculty members. The advisor determines the
student's semester grades in honors, while the two external readers recommend to the department that the project receive Highest Honors, Honors, or no Honors.
Honors of any kind are contingent upon satisfactory completion of courses in the major during the senior year. Highest Honors are normally awarded only to
students whose performance in both the honors program and regular courses in the major has been exceptional.
COURSES
100-LEVEL COURSES (except English 150)
Through small class discussions (limited in size to 19 students per section) and frequent writing assignments, 100-level English courses ask
students to develop their skills as readers and as analytical writers. These courses are prerequisites for taking most other English courses.
Students who receive a 5 on the AP English Literature exam may take upper-level courses without first taking a 100-level. All 100-level
English courses are writing intensive, requiring at least 20 pages of writing in a series of four or more formal essays.
ENGL 105(F) Poetry and Magic (W)
Ancient Celtic texts--Irish and Welsh--associate the poet (meaning any creator of fiction) with powerful magic--with shape-shifting, access to the other-world,
and visions of transcendent authority and truth. Plato, in his famous condemnation of poetry in The Republic, also associates poetry with magic, but with magic as
a con game or sleight-of-hand trick. This course will use Plato and Celtic texts to establish a theoretical framework for reading and interpreting the representation
of poetry and magic in a variety of literary works from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century. The goal of the course is to develop effective reading and writing
strategies for works of different genres and time periods. Reading will include Chaucer's Friar's Tale (where the poet-figure is a devil); Marlowe's Doctor Faus-
tus (where the poet-figure sells his soul to the devil for magical power); Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream and The Tempest (where fairies and magic
represent the positive power of imagination); and short poems by Coleridge, Keats, Tennyson, and Yeats.
The class will be run as a discussion. Requirements: a mix of writing assignments, formal and informal, totaling about 25 pages. Students will be evaluated on
writing and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 111(F) Poetry and Politics (W)
"Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world" wrote Shelley in his 1821 "Defence of Poetry," countering the widely held view of poetry's airy irrele-
vance to the material progress of humanity. His claims are echoed a century and a half later in Audre Lorde's "Poetry is Not a Luxury," in which she argues that
poetry is a vital and essential part of her own political struggle as a Black lesbian feminist. But when W.B. Yeats--himself a very politically involved poet--
writes in 1917 that "from the quarrel with others comes rhetoric; from the quarrel with ourselves comes poetry," he implies that poetry would suffer from too
much involvement with the "quarrel with others" that is politics, becoming, perhaps, something more like advertising jingles for political dogma. And when W.
H. Auden writes in 1939 that "poetry makes nothing happen" he appears to locate poetry's value precisely in its irrelevance to politics as such. This course will
focus on the vexed relationship between poetry and political struggle, reading predominantly poetry and poetics (writings about poetry) of the last two centuries in
an effort to answer the questions: what can poetry do for politics? what does politics do for (or to) poetry? Is poetry essential to political struggle, or do poetry and
politics mix only to the detriment of both, producing, on the one hand, bad poetry, and on the other, mere distractions from the "real" work of politics? The
primary goal of the course is to make students better readers of poetry, and better readers and writers of argumentative prose.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and 20 pages of writing in the form of frequent short papers.
No prerequisites; no prior experience with poetry (or politics!) is expected. . Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 113(F) Modernist British Fiction (W)
In the first three decades of the twentieth century, writers in Britain, Europe, and America--participating in the creative explosion of revolutionary aesthetic
movements known collectively as modernism--transformed our understanding of the art of fiction. Modernist writers boldly diverged from the norms and con-
ventions of classical realist fiction, in an array of exciting, if sometimes bewildering, formal innovations. They upended the stability of realist narration through
the use of shifting, unorthodox points of view, unreliable narrators, disorienting time-shifts, and ostentatious authorial self-consciousness, and through the scrutiny
of problems of memory and representation; they reconceived the nature of subjectivity; they re-defined what counts as an "event"; and they made fiction operate
more like poetry, by shifting the reader's attention from a linear, character-oriented unfolding of plot to what has been called a "spatial" organization of metaphoric
and conceptual patterns. In this course we will explore this sweeping revision of the nature of fiction by studying several great, often challenging modernist works
of short fiction: stories, novellas, and short novels by such British writers as Joseph Conrad, James Joyce, E. M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, and Ford Madox Ford,
and perhaps by one or two Continental writers such as Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka. Our principal aim will be to develop students' skills as readers and
interpreters of fiction. A secondary benefit of the course will be to introduce students to literary modernism through a survey of some of its greatest exponents.
Format: dicussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, and frequent, rigorous writing in the form of short papers and brief written
exercises (totalling about 20 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 8:30-9:45 TR TIFFT
ENGL 114(F) Literary Speakers (W)
The general purpose of this course is to develop students' skills as interpreters of poetry and short fiction. Its particular focus is on how-and with what effects-
poets create the voices of their poems, and fiction writers create their narrators. We'll consider the ways in which literary speakers inform and entice, persuade and
sometimes deceive, their audiences. Readings will include texts from various historical periods, with particular emphasis on the twentieth century (including
works by James Joyce, Henry James, Vladimir Nabokov, Robert Frost, Toni Cade Bambara, Raymond Carver, and Seamus Heaney).
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: a discussion class with emphasis on close reading and frequent, careful writing (about 20 pages, in the form of short
papers).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF FIX
ENGL 117(F) Introduction to Cultural Theory (Same as Comparative Literature 117) (W)
This course has a clear purpose. If you had signed up for a course in biology, you would know that you were about to embark on the systematic study of living
organisms. If you were registered for a course on the American Civil War, you would know that there had been an armed conflict between the northern and
southern states in the 1860s. But if you decide you want to study "culture," what exactly is it that you are studying? The aim of this course is not to come up with
handy and reassuring definitions for this word, but to show you why it is so hard to come up with such definitions. People fight about what the word "culture"
125
means, and our main business will be to get an overview of that conceptual brawl. We will pay special attention to the conflict between those thinkers who see
culture as a realm of freedom or equality or independence or critical thought and those thinkers who see culture as a special form of bondage, a prison without
walls. The course will be organized around short theoretical readings by authors ranging from Matthew Arnold to Constance Penley, but we will also, in order to
put our new ideas to the test, watch several films (Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Silence of the Lambs, The Lord of the Rings) and listen to a lot of rock & roll. Why do
you think culture matters? Once you stop to pose that question, there's no turning back.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: five short papers totaling about 20 pages, class attendance and participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students. Two sections.

(See under COMP 111 for full description.) C. BOLTON
ENGL 121(S) Precocity (W)
Precocity--knowing too much too early and without understanding the implications of what you know--is often the subject of literary texts, perhaps because it
dramatizes the stakes of interpreting. Precocity can emerge in a character, as a narrative posture or in the very texture of the writing. It can produce highly charged
dramatic situations, comic or ruinous; it can precipitate crises of character and of narrative; and it can transform the terms within which an historical moment is
conceived. Readings will include works by Borges, Nabokov, James, and Stoppard; approximately half of the course will be devoted to reading a range of poems
from the seventeenth century to the present.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: students will write five short papers totaling 20 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF SOKOLSKY
ENGL 123(S) Borrowing and Stealing: Originality in Literature and Culture (W)
Someone once said that bad poets borrow and good poets steal, suggesting that acts of theft, as well as their subsequent cover-ups, may lie behind some of the best
and seemingly most original works of art in history. And it's not just the poets. More recently, an exhibition of artworks using copyrighted material, called "Illegal
Art," has challenged current U.S. copyright law. Given the ubiquity of visual, electronic, and audio borrowing and sampling in contemporary art, one might
wonder if anyone even bothers to create alibis for today's artistic thefts. This course will investigate ideas about artistic and intellectual influence, inspiration,
borrowing, revision, appropriation, and outright stealing. We will ask a series of questions as we look at a variety of material, mostly literary, but also visual and
musical, that troubles ideas about novel and derivative art. Where does influence stop and plagiarism begin? What must be forgotten, or remembered, about
earlier works of art for a new one to appear to be just that--new? Do aesthetic techniques of reframing and recontextualization have a history? The course will
consider these questions mostly by engaging artworks that raise such questions, but also will read work in critical theory about authorship and copyright. We'll
spend time thinking about uncreative art and boring art, and consider what aesthetic categories are mobilized in conceptual art by visiting Sol Lewitt's installation
at MassMOCA. Throughout, we will refine our sense of the relations among fiction, art, originality, and imitation by studying some of the best acts of artistic and
intellectual theft of the recent past. Readings: Roland Barthes, T.S. Eliot, Wordsworth and Coleridge, Borges, Oscar Wilde (lots), Sigmund Freud, Vladimir
Nabokov, Andy Warhol, Christian Bk.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: intense reading; 20 pages of writing in the form of frequent short papers; active, substantial class participation; weekly
online reading responses.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first year.

ENGL 124(F) Family Matters (W)
"Anyone who has survived childhood has enough material to write for the rest of his or her life" (Flannery O'Connor). A course designed to explore the represen-
tations of family in recent American literature. Family is our first community, and in the literature of family one commonly accepted and undisputed convention
emerges: parents and children are morally bound to one another. These bonds of blood, both liberating and limiting, have always been a literary convention. In this
course, we will examine recent American fiction that explores such bonds. What do such narratives claim we want from our families? What do such narratives
claim we're willing to do to get it? Have recent narratives developed particular and characteristic strategies for approaching this topic? And are there importantly
particularizing aspects of the American family? Authors to be considered may include: Rick Moody, Junot Diaz, Andre Dubus, Cormac McCarthy, Lorrie
Moore, Gish Jen, Adam Haslett, Grace Paley, and Jonathan Franzen.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and 20 pages of writing in the form of frequent short papers. Students will also be responsi-
ble for teaching one class on a published work.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students. Two sections.

ENGL 129(S) Twentieth-Century Black Poets (Same as Africana Studies 129) (W)
From Langston Hughes to contemporary poets such as Amiri Baraka and Angela Jackson, African American poets have been preoccupied with the relations of
poetry to other traditions. Vernacular speech, English poetry, jazz and other musical forms, folk humor and African mythology have all been seen as essential
sources for black poetry. This course will survey major poets such as Hughes, James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Robert Hayden, Gwendolyn Brooks,
Baraka, Jackson, and Yusef Komunyakaa, reading their poems and their essays and interviews about poetic craft. We will ask how black poetry has been defined
and whether there is a single black poetic tradition or several.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: 20 pages of writing in the form of a journal on the readings and several short papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF D. L. SMITH
ENGL 133(S) New Poetry (W)
In this class we will read or otherwise experience a range of poetry being produced right now in the U.S. Some of this poetry doesn't immediately seem to "fit" in
the classroom: it's too new, too weird, too raw, too cerebral, too multi-media, too performance-oriented, somehow "unteachable." The premise of the course is
that by engaging with these diverse voices we will come up with ways of talking about them, and that in the process we will have to take up some big and
interesting questions: What is poetry? Can it be defined? How does poetry aim to affect us? Does one need "expertise" to appreciate it? And: is poetry important?
Does it matter--socially, politically, culturally? The course is aimed at lovers of poetry, those who dislike poetry, those who are intimidated by the idea of it, and
those who can't see why we should bother. Readings will be structured around the work of the poets coming to Williams to read, and may also include some "old
poetry" (for purposes of comparison), critical articles, and manifestos; we will also watch documentaries or listen to CDs of more performance-oriented work
(e.g., slam, spoken word).
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: regular participation; 4 short (from 2-3 to 5-6 pp.) papers, of which you will be asked to revise two; one essay will be a
research paper on a poet or poetic movement of your choice. Occasional group projects and short postings for class discussion. This course is part of the Critical
Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.

ENGL 135(F) Vengeance (W)
For almost three thousand years revenge has been a central preoccupation of European literature. Revenge is inviting to literary and dramatic treatment partly
because of its impulse towards structure: it traces a simple arc of injury and retaliation. A injures B, and B retaliates against A. But retaliation is never easy or
equivalent, and there is always a volatile emotive mixture of loss and grievance that stirs up ethical ambiguities that are seldom resolved. Vengeance also fasci-
nates because it is so paradoxical. The avenger, though isolated and vulnerable, can nevertheless achieve heroic grandeur by coming to personify nemesis. And
yet the hero is always contaminated by trying to make a right out of two wrongs--and he usually has to die for it. Driven by past events, cut off from the present,
and rapt up in stratagems for future reprisals, the avenger's actions are almost always compromised by impotence or excess. At best, revenge is "a kinde of Wilde
Iustice"--a justice that kills its heroes as well as its villains.
We will look at as many stories of vengeance, across as wide a range of cultures and media, as possible.
Format: discussion/seminar. Evaluation will be based upon class participation; four short papers (5 pages), one of which will be revised into a longer critical essay
(of 10-12 pages). Preference will be given to first-year students and then to sophomores. No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).
This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills initiative.

clude: The Tempest and Forbidden Planet, Lear and Chekhov's "Swan Song," The Merchant of Venice and Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be, Hamlet and "The
Skinhead Hamlet."

ENGL 138(S) A Love for Literature (Same as Africana Studies 138 and American Studies 138) (W)
...might be a troubling thing, if you examine it closely. Like stamp-collecting, say, it sounds a little old-fashioned these days, a little lonely and sad, probably
harmless but possibly pathetic--no offense! Like any other love, it demands loyalties and incites betrayals, and its contradictions become more volatile as its
passion becomes more intense. And like anything else, it testifies to the burden of its history as much through what it forgets as through what it chooses to
remember.
In this course, we'll encounter this love for literature as manifested, in ambivalent and often vexed ways, by African American and Asian American writers as
they reflect on literacy, culture, and the "civilizing mission." We will consider how this love bears the weight of histories of slavery, conquest, exploitation, and
violence, and how it has been appropriated, recast, or rejected in pursuit of freedom and/or privilege. Readings may include works by Gwendolyn Brooks, Har-
ryette Mullen, Carlos Bulosan, Jos Garcia Villa, Jessica Hagedorn, Monique Truong, C.L.R. James, and Jamaica Kincaid.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and four to five short papers totaling about 20 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 139(F) Metafiction (Same as Comparative Literature 139) (W)
This course will examine some of the ways in which literary works reflect on their status as texts. We'll look at the formal pleasures and puzzles generated by
techniques including frame narratives, recursion, self-reference and readerly address, in texts ranging from the Book of Genesis to films by Spike Jonze, to novels
by Vladimir Nabokov and Thomas Pynchon. Ultimately, we will use our study of metafiction to focus a larger inquiry into the socializing force of language in
human development. Note that students will be required to use, as well as interpret, metafictional techniques in much of their assigned writing.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: five papers of increasingly complexity, totaling 24 pages; consistent attendance and participation; a willingness to
reread.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 144(S) Whodunit? The Ethnic Detective Novel and its Permutations (Same as American Studies 144) (W)
The many variations of the detective novel--from the British "cozy" to American "hardboiled" thrillers--have long been staples of popular culture. The pleasure
that many derive from it is, oddly enough, formed by a deeply paradoxical nature of the genre: the surprise of the final revelation combined with the predictability
of its narrative form and devices. Yet this very predictability has also allowed writers to use the conventions of the mystery novel to achieve different effects, to tell
other stories, and oftentimes to transgress the genre itself. In this class, we will read and discuss works by various American ethnic writers and their use of the
forms and conventions of the mystery novel to ask: how do we understand the relationship between ethnic identities, histories, experiences and the genres, con-
ventions, and other elements of detective fictions? How do the different writers use conventions of detective fictions, and to what purposes?
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active in-class participation (including short presentations), short response assignments, and a final paper (6-8 pages)
on a detective novel of your choice (can be chosen from or beyond the course readings)
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:19 (exepected: 19). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 150(F,S) Expository Writing (W)
The goal of this course is to teach you how to write a clear, well-argued, and interesting analytical paper, although to accomplish this we will experiment with
other types of writing as well. There is no required text, but at least occasionally you will be asked to read professional work, looking for inspiration. We will
spend most of our class-time examining and workshopping a series of weekly writing assignments, as well as two longer projects, one due in the middle of the
semester, one at the end. Though the skills you learn will be applicable to other disciplines, and the purpose of the course is to improve all aspects of your writing,
this is an English class, designed partly to prepare you for upper level courses in the English Department. This means that the subject matter will tend toward the
traditional interests of the field--the interpretation of literature and other works of art.
Format: workshop. Requirements: weekly writing assignments, plus two longish essays, which will have to go through at least one stage of revision.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected 12). Preference given to first-year students.

ENGL 201(F) Shakespeare's Strangers
Shakespeare is uncannily acute about the ethical and representational issues posed by the appearance of the alien in the midst of a familiar world. The Moor, the
Jew, the madman, the ghost: the stranger emerges from elsewhere, but also from within, and always poses fundamental questions about the nature and grounds of
self and community. We'll use the figure of the other as a route into some of Shakespeare most compelling works, including Midsummer Night's Dream, Mer-
chant of Venice, Othello, Macbeth, Hamlet, Coriolanus, and The Tempest.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: two papers and a final exam.

ENGL 203(F) Reading Films (Same as Comparative Literature 223)
An introduction to film analysis, emphasizing the role played by mise-en-scene, editing, cinematography, and sound. In addition, we will consider aspects of film
history, including the role of genre and the contrasting narrative conventions prevailing in Hollywood and in different national traditions, such as the silent cinema
of the Soviet montage and the French New Wave. Critical readings will be assigned, as we examine films by directors such as Eisenstein, Renoir, Welles, Kuroso-
wa, Hitchcock, and Almodovar.
Format: lecure/discussion. Requirements will include several short responses, a seven page critical essay, a midterm, and a final exam. Active participation in will
be required, along with a willingness to view course films more than once.

ENGL 205(F) The Art of Poetry
"If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off," Emily Dickinson wrote, "I know that is poetry." This course will explore the particular pleasures and
excitements of poetry, taking up a wide range of poets--John Donne, Robert Frost, Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Hayden, e.e. cummings, Louise Glck, William
Butler Yeats, Stephen Dunn, Elizabeth Alexander, Edwin Arlington Robinson, and many others. We will raise such questions as, How exactly is poetry different
from prose? Can we ever determine the "true" meaning of any poem? Can we reasonably argue that some poems are good and some are bad? How is our reading
of a poem affected by what we know about the author, or the historical moment when the poem was composed, or the shape of the book in which it first appeared?
What, finally, can a poem do to us?
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: two papers (about 5-6 pages each), a number of short exercises, and regular class participation.
Prerequisite: a 100-level English course. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 19). Preference given to first-year students who have placed out of a 100-level English

ENGL 210(S) American Modernism (Same as American Studies 210)
"Modernism" in literature refers to texts from the second half of the nineteenth through the first half of the twentieth century. These works are typically at once
self-referential and extra-referential; books acutely aware of their own status as language nevertheless aspire to describe, or even save, the world beyond words.
Insofar as modernism posits an aestheticism that can seem redemptive, a concern of the course will be the relation of modernism to modernity: the new world that
needs saving. The American version of modernism will have the additional challenge of producing out of the difficulties of self-conscious fiction a redemption
that suits a democracy--and a multiply divided democracy at that. Writers of the course will include DuBois, Larsen, Hemingway, Faulkner, Stein, Toomer,
Hurston, Williams and Agee.
Format: discussion. Requirements: two short papers, one longer (10 pp.) final paper.
Prerequisite: 100-level English course. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25). Preference to sophomores.

critical writing.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation, two 5- to 7-page papers, several short writing assignments, and a final exam.

ENGL 219(F) Introduction to Asian American Literature (Same as American Studies 219)
To paraphrase critic Elaine Kim, Asian American literature may be understood as literature of contradictions: it names both common experiences and divergent,
sometimes conflicting ones; it articulates national belonging and extra-national critique; it constitutes a literary tradition while pushing and questioning the limits
of this category. Our readings and discussions will reflect and keep alive these contradictions, and in this spirit, will examine 20th century Asian American
literatures as reflective and constitutive of both socio-historical experiences and an emergent literary tradition. Our authors include Hisaye Yamamoto, Jessica
Hagedorn, Shawn Wong, and Monique Truong, among others. While these literary texts provide the primary grounding for our inquiries, we will also approach
them through an interdisciplinary lens and supplement the readings with works in Asian Americanist scholarship from other fields like history and sociology.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: short response assignmnets, a final project (in-class presentation) and paper (6-8 pages).

Vladimir Nabokov, Ernest Hemingway, Kurt Vonnegut, J.D Salinger, Flannery O'Connor and Franz Kafka, as well as more contemporary (living) writers like
Woody Allen, Mary Gaitskill, Rick Moody, Etgar Keret and Miranda July. Students will read one short story every week and produce a response to it, in visual or
written form.
In the first meeting of the week, we will discuss that week's story and figure out interesting ways to go about responding to it. The second meeting of the week will
be devoted to peer review and discussion of student responses to the stories. Student responses might include short fiction, poetry, non-fiction prose, drawing,
photography (digital and film) and video. Ideal students for this class are visual artists interested in writing and writers interested in creating visual work.

GATEWAY COURSES
200-level "Gateway" courses are designed for first- and second-year students contemplating the major or intending to pursue more advanced

ENGL 215(S) Imagining Immigrants (Gateway) (W) (D)
The goal in this course is two-fold: to become more responsive readers of literature and more empathetic readers of cultural differences.
As Othello and Antony and Cleopatra demonstrate, the conflicts, anxieties, and vulnerabilities faced by today's immigrants have a long history. Moving physical-
ly from one culture to another but remaining imaginatively torn between their adopted country and their country of origin, feeling at times like a stranger to both,
immigrants face questions that concern us all in our increasingly global society, questions of identity, liminality, alienation, empathy, and language. Bombarded by
a language that is not their own, immigrants are constantly thinking about what words mean both literally and symbolically. Why this word rather than another?
How do humor and irony work in a foreign culture? How do writers reconcile the pressures of the present moment with the stream of memories from the old
country? How is one person's point of view, or one society's point of view, different from another's? How can metaphors convey the experience of constantly
seeing an object, or an entire world, in terms of another? In addition to Shakespeare's Othello and Antony and Cleopatra, we will study theoretical essays, short
stories, novels, poems, and imaginative non-fiction such as Vladimir Nabokov's Pnin, Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior, Zadie Smith's White Teeth,
Cristina Garcia's Dreaming in Cuban, Nicole Krauss's The History of Love, Jhumpa Lahiri's The Interpreter of Maladies, W. G. Sebald's The Emigrants, Li-
Young Lee's Rose, and films such as Dirty Pretty Things, The Emigrants, or The Godfather Part 2. This course explores differences and similarities between
cultures and societies in the modern world, and between the modern world and the past.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: four short formal essays plus informal journal entries.
Prerequisite: a 100-level English course. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to first-year students who have taken a prior English course, or

ENGL 220(F) Introduction to African American Writing (Same as Africana Studies 220 and American Studies 220) (Gateway) (W)
Toni Morrison has described her writing as guided by a musician's imperative always to hold something in reserve, to leave her audience wanting something
more. It's a simple idea, but a strange one--that a reader's desire might be fulfilled only by its increase, that its satisfaction requires that it is never enough. African
American writing, in all its richness and variety, moves between never enough and something more; this course will introduce just a few of the historical experi-
ences, intellectual currents, cultural resources, thematic preoccupations, and formal strategies encountered in this writing, and consider how and to what ends
African American literary tradition(s) have been organized, in critical and polemical ways, by individual writers and scholars, and by artistic and political move-
ments. We'll forego the perspective of a grand overview, diving right in instead, and we won't necessarily always reach for the best-known titles by the most
famous authors. In any case, by the end of the course, you should be prepared to have more left to read than you did at the beginning.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation and four or five short essays, totalling about 20-25 pages.

ENGL 226(F) Irish Revivals (Gateway) (W)
This course will focus on Irish literature of the last two centuries as a case study in the way history, culture and politics interact in the formation of a distinctive
literary tradition. We will begin with an overview of the literature of the Gaelic and early colonial periods, and briefly consider texts from the Irish Revival of
c.1800-1830, during which the problems of Irish cultural self-definition in a colonial context--the effort to assert "Irishness" as an identity distinct from English-
ness--became sharply outlined. Our principal focus, though, will be on the Irish Renaissance of c.1890-1925, during which Irish writing in the English language
became firmly established as a canon clearly separate from the English tradition, and writers such as Yeats and Joyce achieved international renown. Readings
will include drama, poetry, fiction and non-fiction prose by Yeats, Synge, Joyce, George Moore, Somerville and Ross, George Bernard Shaw, Lady Gregory, Sean
O'Casey and others. We will foreground key fault-lines of the period-competing visions of "authentic" Irish identity; debate over the propriety of writing in
English, drawing on English literary traditions, or seeking a non-Irish audience; the work of "self-exiles" such as Shaw and Joyce, versus that of writers who
stayed in Ireland; and the long-entrenched ideological and political tensions between Catholics and Protestants, and landowners and tenants--all the while con-
sidering the functions and efficacy of literature itself in promoting cultural and/or political change. The course will conclude by considering the extraordinary
current vitality of Irish literary culture, with readings of work by Brendan Behan, Seamus Heaney and discussion of Neil Jordan's film "The Crying Game." Key
considerations here will be the ways traditional notions of Irish Nationalism and national identity have been revised or abandoned under the impact of indepen-
dence, economic prosperity, contemporary sexual politics and other forms of recent cultural change.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four papers (3-4 pages for the first, rising to 6-8 pages for the last), several short journal-style writing assignments, and
active participation in discussions.

ENGL 228(S) Graphic Storytelling (Gateway) (W)
Telling stories in pictures, rather than words, is a persistent interest in all cultures at all times, but technological innovation has allowed picture storytelling to
blossom in the last 300 years or so, producing the image and video-saturated world we live in today. The various forms of picture-storytelling have arguably
displaced written words as our dominant storytelling mode. In this course we will focus on storytelling in pictures, through both historical examples and contem-
porary examples. We will consider older forms of picture-storytelling in paintings and engravings; the birth of the modern comic-strip and also its ubiquitous
descendent, the comic book, along with their upscale and even snooty relative the "graphic novel;" and we will consider video storytelling, along with animation.
We will energize our thinking through steady comparison to storytelling in words, and through critical and theoretical readings.
Requirements: active class participation and four or five short essays, totalling about 20-25 pages.

ENGL 235(F) Comedy/Tragedy (Same as Comparative Literature 234) (Gateway) (W)
"Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall down an open manhole cover and die." Critics have long sought to define comedy and tragedy
against each other, yet, as Mel Brooks' joke suggests, the relationship between the two is complicated, even disturbing. In this course we will read tragedies by
Sophocles and Racine, comedies by Shakespeare and Molire, and works that do not easily fit either classification by Chekhov, Beckett and Stoppard. We will
consider how in different periods the distinction between the two forms has been understood and their antithetical effects accounted for. We will discuss the
essential if also problematic link between suffering and pleasure, and ask why it is that comedy persists while tragedy, at least in its classical expression, no longer
seems possible. Critical readings will include Aristotle's Poetics, Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy, and Bergson's Laughter.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: four or five short essays, including at least one revision. There will also be periodic film screenings.

ENGL 237(S) Gender and Desire 1200-1600 (Same as Comparative Literature 237 and Women's and Gender Studies 237) (Gateway)
(W) (D)
The celebration of "courtly love" by medieval and Renaissance writers institutionalized the notion of the desiring male subject and the desired female object that
continues to reverberate in contemporary culture. But early writers do not always, or even usually, endorse these positions uncritically, and even works that
elevate heterosexual love devote surprisingly large spaces to other kinds of desire. What does it mean, for example, that the fountain of Narcissus occupies the
center of the garden of courtly love in the Romance of the Rose? That despite the Lover's proclaimed desire to "possess" the Rose, it is the male God of Love he
kisses on the mouth? Shakespeare's comedies end famously with triple and quadruple marriages, but how should we read the cross-dressing and gender confu-
sion that occupy so much of the plots beforehand? As we explore these and other issues, we will supplement our literary readings with theoretical texts drawn
from medieval and Renaissance treatises as well as contemporary feminist, psychoanalytic, and queer theory. The goal of the course is to sharpen critical reading
and writing skills across a broad range of literary forms and historical, cultural and aesthetic values. As part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative, this course
focuses on relationships between same-sex and heterosexual desire in a variety of major pre- and early modern works, and in the analyses of contemporary critics
who undertake to explain (or explain away) the same-sex desire in them. In doing that, of course, we explore our own values and assumptions in a much longer
historical context than usual.

ENGL 258(F) Poetry and the City (Gateway) (W)
In this course we will consider poems generated out of the experiences of urban life. The city provides for poets a vivid mental and imaginative landscape in
which to consider the relation of vice and squalor to glamour; the nature of anonymity and distinction; and the pressure of myriad bodies on individual conscious-
ness. We will explore ways in which the poet's role in the body politic emerges in representations of the city as a site both of civilized values and/or struggles for
power marked by guile and betrayal. Taking into account the ways in which cities have been transformed over time by changing social and economic conditions,
we will consider such issues as what the New York of the 1950s has to do with the London of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and why poetry as
a genre might be particularly suited to representing the shifting aspects of urban life. Poets will include Dante, Pope, Swift, Blake, Wordsworth, Whitman,
Baudelaire, Arnold, Yeats, Crane, Moore, Auden, Hughes, Bishop, Ginsberg, Baraka, and Ashbery. We will also draw on essays by Simmel, Benjamin, Williams,
and Canetti, photographs by Hines, Weegee, and Abbott; the blues, as sung by Holliday and Vaughan; and films such as Man with a Movie Camera, Rear
Window, and Breathless.

ENGL 262(S) (formerly 356) Confession and Catharsis in the Poetry of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes (Same as Women's and Gender Studies
262) (Gateway) (W)
Ted Hughes's publication of Birthday Letters in January, 1998, was portrayed in the press and reviews as breaking a 35-year silence on his wife Sylvia Plath's
suicide in 1963. What made this volume of poems a bestseller was its confessional and biographical drama. Hughes addresses his dead spouse and returns to all of
the major events in their shared life, simultaneously exposing his feelings and intuitions about what went wrong in their marriage and why Plath was driven to
take her life. Less evident to the general reading public was that Birthday Letters extends a dialogue between Plath and Hughes on the nature of poetry and poetic
identity that began in their courtship. Plath felt that Hughes initiated her into a strong feminine voice, and she, in turn, was responsible for introducing Hughes's
poems, perceived as infused with violence and virility, to an American audience. The poems that made Plath famous posthumously, however, were written in
response to her separation from Hughes and to his extramarital affair, and were collected in a volume titled Ariel that was altered by Hughes and published after
her death. This course will explore the Plath-Hughes marriage, both biographically and poetically. Topics may include: the conflict between Plath's confessional
sensibility and Hughes's sense of her intrusion on their private life; the role of biography generally in literary interpretation; the vilification of Hughes by feminists
and the impact they had on both his poetry and the way he published Plath's poems, journals, and novel; and the extent to which some of Hughes's final publica-
tions constitute "having the last word" on both personal and poetic disagreements with his dead wife.

Of Plimouth Plantation to Will Smith's remake of I Am Legend. Through the study of novels, memoirs, captivity narratives, action films and journalism, we will
consider the ways in which different narrative forms complicate and transform our imagination of what counts as bondage, and what as freedom.

A study of the origins of the Arthurian story in Welsh history and folklore and a survey of its development and transformations in the romance literature of
England and the Continent, from Chrtien de Troyes to Thomas Malory, circa 1100-1500. We will pay special attention to the ways in which British/English
nationalism, Celtic magic, French courtly values (those connected with love and chivalry in particular), and Christian morality combine and recombine to pro-
duce ever new meaning in familiar elements of the plot: Arthur's birth and establishment as king, the fellowship and adventures of his followers, the adulterous

ENGL 312(S) Shakespeare and Magic
The mysterious powers of magic play an important, often problematic, and always challenging role in many of Shakespeare's plays--Puck's flower, Othello's
handkerchief, Macbeth's witches, Prospero's books. But how devious--or how redemptive--are these forces? What is the audience expected to believe, ques-
tion, or wonder about? How much actual power should we suppose a magician--or a witch--possesses, and what are its costs? How are the deceptions of magic
like the manipulations of the theater? In this seminar we'll look closely at the different ways magic operates in five of Shakespeare's plays: A Midsummer Night's
Dream, Othello, Macbeth, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, one short (5 page), and one long (10-15 page) paper.

tary decree in 1642. We will focus on the sensational aspects of these works--their preoccupation with revenge, black magic, sexual ambiguity and grotesque
violence--and also on their technical virtuosity. Authors will include Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Kyd, William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, John Webster and
Cyril Tourneur.

ENGL 323T(S) A Novel Education (W)
All novels are conscious of their readers; eighteenth-century novels are obsessed with them. In the century when the genre first flourished, readers are the ultimate
objects of novelists' plots. We are addressed, teased, pleaded with, embarrassed, flattered, made fun of, praised, chided, solicited, warned, reminded, rebuked,
asked for sympathy, and-always-closely watched. Eighteenth-century novelists-and their narrators-aggressively educate their readers, not only teaching us how to
interpret the novel itself, but also demanding that we self-consciously question the powers of mind and habits of heart we bring to the process of interpreting a
book, ourselves, and our world. In this tutorial course, we will explore the narrative and rhetorical strategies two of the century's greatest novelists use in creating,
shaping, and finally educating their readers. We will focus principally on Henry Fielding's Tom Jones (1749) and Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy
(1760-67)--long, brilliantly intricate novels that go about their work in very different ways, but that are equally committed to the project of giving their readers a
novel education. We will consider--much more briefly--Fielding's Joseph Andrews, and Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. We will also read criticism by such
"reader response" theorists as Stanley Fish and Wolfgang Iser, and--in the individualized setting of a tutorial--students will be asked to develop and articulate
their own theories of reading by examining critically the ways in which texts affect and educate them.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week; they will write a 5- to 7-page paper every other week (five in
all), and comment on their partners' papers in alternate weeks. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills not only in reading and interpretation, but also in
constructing critical arguments and responding to them in written and oral critiques.

ENGL 327(S) Fictions of the British Raj (D)
The great impact of the British Raj-- the 200-year dominion of the British Empire over most of the Indian subcontinent--on the people of what we now know as
India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh sometimes leads us to forget how powerfully India influenced the British in turn. British colonizers found themselves both
fascinated and, in turn, subtly shaped by the largely imaginary India that their ideology had led them to project, and as the Empire's struggle to control a vast and
bewilderingly diverse land showed increasing strains, they were forced to recognize the ways in which what it meant to be English had been distorted and re-de-
fined by their projections and by the exercise of their own power. Conversely, educated Indians were induced to construct for themselves hybrid, Anglicized
identities and modes of behavior that complicated their social and political relations with the less fortunate majority of their fellow Indians. This course focuses
principally on fiction about India written in English during the last half-century of the Raj (1900-1947), by both Indian and British novelists. In it we will consider
such issues as what it might mean to be "authentically" Indian; how religion and caste complicate political identity and behavior in British India; to what extent
adapting to British structures of authority--even simply writing in English--may compromise an Indian's efforts to speak and act for his or her people; how the
politics of colonization are reflected in ideologies and conflicts of gender; in what ways the identity and social relations of both Anglo-Indian and indigenous
communities were changed by the emergence of nationalist movements such as Gandhi's Congress party and the Muslim League; and how such socio-political
issues are mediated in the successive modes of fiction (Victorian romance, modernism, social realism) adopted by the writers we will study. While some readings
will introduce important religious and political contexts, as well as theoretical models for understanding colonialist ideologies, our principal analytic attention will
be literary, focused on novels such as Kipling's Kim, Forster's A Passage to India, Narayan's Swami and Friends, Anand's Untouchable, and Rao's Kanthapura.
We will also study films by the great Indian director Satyajit Ray, and may read one or two works translated into English from Bengali (e.g., Tagore's The Home
and the World) or set in our period but written after it (e.g., Rushdie's Midnight's Children).

Austen and Eliot profoundly influenced the course of the novel by making internal consciousness crucial to narrative form. In this course we will explore Austen's
innovative aesthetic strategies and the ways in which Eliot assimilated and transformed them. By placing each writer's work in its political and philosophical
context-in Austen's case, reactions to the aftermath of the French Revolution, in Eliot's, to the failed mid-century European revolutions and the pressures of
British imperialism-we will consider how each writer conceives social exigencies to shape dramas of consciousness. Readings will include Austen's Pride and
Prejudice, Emma, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion; Eliot's The Mill on the Floss, The Lifted Veil, and Daniel Deronda; selected letters and prose; essays by Burke
and Marx; and recent criticism. F

ENGL 331T(F) Romantic Experiments (W)
Many works of the Romantic period (from about 1760 to about 1830) are pointedly or at least intentionally strange. Romantic writers were devoted innovators,
and it is the Romantic period which gives our culture its interest in what we now call "originality." Some Romantic experimenting seems radical even today, as
writers try to invent new ways of meaning, try to reach beyond the usual notions of Sense and Nonsense. Some of it is corrective, born of the hope that the world
would become a better place if they could write a new literature. Some of it is splashy newness, an attempt to catch a jaded readership's attention in new ways; and
some of it is just ecstatic, deeply personal Weirdness. We will think about Romantic innovation by matching it with the writing it was meant to disrupt or reform;
though some works we will simply have to wade into and encounter on their own terms. Authors to be considered might include Barbauld, Blake, Byron, Coler-
idge, Hemans, Keats, Shelley, and Wordsworth.
Format: tutorial; students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Requirements: they will write a 5- to 7-page paper every other week (five in

ENGL 332(F) Colonial Subjects (D)
For almost 150 years--from the late seventeenth through the early nineteenth centuries--dramatizations of Aphra Behn's Oronooko, the fictional account of a
slave revolt in Surinam, were among the most popular offerings on the London stage; by the late 18th century the title role was commonly played by black actors,
some of whom had themselves been slaves, and whose other roles would have ranged from Othello to the villainous "Obi, or Three-Fingered Jack." The same
period saw the consolidation of modern botanical and zoological classificatory systems, the emergence of the social sciences (political economy, anthropology,
sociology), and the birth of the modern museum. What these phenomena have in common are a complex relation to British colonial expansion and imperial rule,
which produced not just the subjection of non-British people, but also, new "subjects" of representation and knowledge. This course will examine a rich array of
texts and visual materials that suggest the disruptive and transformative effects Britain's imperial projects had on ways of seeing and knowing, both within and
outside the metropolis. Materials will include Behn's Oroonoko and 18th and 19th century London stage adaptations of the novel, along with a modern adaptation
by Nigerian writer Biyi Bandele (performed for a London audience in 1999); travel narratives, including the journals and anthropological, botanical, and zoologi-
cal images from the voyages of Thomas Cook; poetry of Phyllis Wheatley, William Blake, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge; autobiographies and polemics by James
Gronniosaw, Ottobah Cuguano, and Olaudah Equiano; Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and Derek Walcott's Pantomime. We will also read critical and theoretical
material on colonialism and empire. This course is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative; it investigates how attention to the context of colonial power relations
reconfigures our understanding of disciplinary knowledge.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: attendance, active participation, frequent short Blackboard responses to the critical essays, and two 6- to 8-page

ENGL 333(S) The Nineteenth-Century British Novel
Imagine this: a form of art and entertainment that purports to be able to represent everything-intimate, even inaccessible human thoughts and feelings, love, class,
the city, shopping, sexuality, bureaucracy, social bonds, industrialization, nationalism, even modernity itself. In this course we will try to understand the scope of
the nineteenth-century British novel's jaw-dropping representational aspirations: its claim to comprehend in its pages both the dizzying complexity of new social,
political, and economic structures, as well as delineate in finest detail the texture of individual minds and lives. We will pay attention to the ways in which the
novel takes apparently intractable political and social problems and resolves them within stories of romantic love, an act of narrative prestidigitation readers never
seem to tire of. And while we might think of the novel as an Empire of the Little, endlessly occupied with giving significance to the smallest acts of ordinary
human life, we will think about the broader historical and social conditions the novel both represents in its pages, and is a crucial not-so-silent partner in promoting
and contesting. We will also interest ourselves in the kind of under-the- counter work the Victorian novel does on behalf of British empire, as well as empire's own
behind-the-scenes work for the novel. Since so many of these stories of everyday life seem as familiar to us as everyday life, we will work hard to maintain what is
strange and specific about the nineteenth century even as we recognize within these works the birth of so much that is modern in our own culture. Likely authors
include: Austen, C. Bront, Thackeray, Dickens, Eliot, Collins, Hardy.

ENGL 338(S) Literature of the American Renaissance (Same as American Studies 338)
The 1840s and 50s are known as "the American Renaissance," a watershed in American literary history which includes Thoreau's Walden and Melville's Moby-
Dick, Emerson's essays and Hawthorne's fiction. It also includes major abolitionist writings by Frederick Douglass and Harriet Beecher Stowe, Poe's grotesque
tales, and the groundbreaking poetry of Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson. We will explore this essential period by inquiring into the ways these authors figure
emotion, experience, and, identity, both personal and national. We will also consider the belief in the transformational power of language shared by the majority of
our authors, and the strategies they developed in their efforts to call themselves and the nation into new forms of being.

ENGL 340T(F) The Fiction of Virginia Woolf (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 340) (W)
"Let us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall, let us trace the pattern, however disconnected and incoherent in appearance,
which each sight or incident scores upon the consciousness. Let us not take it for granted that life exists more fully in what is commonly thought big than in what is
commonly thought small" ("Modern Fiction"). Virginia Woolf's fiction represents a self-conscious and highly experimental challenge to the conventions of
Victorian and Edwardian fiction. This course will explore her efforts to bridge the gap between experience and its representation in language by following the
evolution of her innovative narrative techniques for portraying consciousness, memory, selfhood, relationships, and community. Along the way, we will consider
Woolf's challenges to stable gender roles and her reconception of women's positions as creators. We will read most of the major novels, including The Voyage
Out, Jacob's Room, Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, The Waves, and Between the Acts, together with selected short fiction and critical essays by Woolf and her
contemporaries, and more recent critical work on Woolf.
Format: tutorial; students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Requirements: students will alternate between writing 5- to 7-page papers
and commentaries on their partner's papers, and will also be required to do a substantial revision of one essay as a final project. Students will be evaluated on their
written work, their oral presentations of that work and their analyses of their colleague's work.

ENGL 341(F) American Genders, American Sexualities (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 341) (D)
This course investigates how sexual identities, desires, and acts are represented and reproduced in American literary and popular culture. Focusing on two cultur-
ally rich periods--roughly 1880-1940 (when the terms "homosexual" and "heterosexual" came to connote discrete sexual identities), and on the last twenty
years--we will explore what it means to read and theorize "queerly." Among the questions we will ask: What counts as "sex" or "sexual identity" in a text? Are
there definably lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer writing styles or cultural practices? What does sexuality have to do with gender? How are sexual
subjectivities intertwined with race, ethnicity, class, and other identities and identifications? And why has "queerness" proven to be such a powerful and some-
times powerfully contested concept? We will also explore what impact particular historical events, such as the rise of sexology, the Harlem Renaissance, and the
emergence of a transgender movement have had on queer cultural production. Readings may include works by the following theorists--Almaguer, Butler, Sedg-
wick, Foucault, Freud, Hammond--as well as James's "The Beast in the Jungle," Stein's QED, Cather's "Paul's Case," Larsen's Passing, Fitzgerald's The Great
Gatsby, Diaz's "Drown," Feinberg's Stone Bitch Blues, and poetry by Lorde, Hughes, Pratt, and Rich, as well as screenings of contemporary videos and films
such as Looking for Langston and The Wedding Banquet.
This course meets the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative in that it focuses on empathetic understanding, power and privilege, and critical theoriza-
tion, especially in relation to class, gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity within a U.S. context.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active class participation, several short writing assignments, two 5-page papers, and one 8- to 10-page paper.

ENGL 343(F) Whitman and Dickinson in Context (W)
In this seminar we will read closely the works of two of the most influential and fascinating poets in the U.S., Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson. In addition to
studying in depth their poems and other writings--in Whitman's case, his essays; in Dickinson's, her letters--we will delve into the major critical debates sur-
rounding their work, both individually and when compared to one another. For example, Whitman is often viewed as perhaps the most public nineteenth-century
American poet, whereas Dickinson is regarded as perhaps the most "private." We will interrogate this assumption, exploring how each poet represents publicity
and privacy in his/her work, as well as their efforts to "perform" and/or reform the American self. Finally, we will explore Whitman's and Dickinson's literary
influence on modern and contemporary American poetry.
Format: discussion. Students will be evaluated on participation in seminar and on written work, including several short papers and one final essay (10 to 12
pages).

During the period from 1965-1976, many writers attempted to develop a literary art based on new emerging conceptions of "blackness." This course will examine
what they understood a "black aesthetic" to be, and how this understanding affected their writing. With a careful eye to their political and cultural contexts, this
course will consider poetry, drama, essays, and fiction by such writers as Amiri Baraka, Sonia Sanchez, Nikki Giovanni, Ishmael Reed, and Toni Cade Bambara.

ENGL 350T(S) The Problem of Modernity and the Modernist Imagination (Same as Comparative Literature 350T) (W)
Historically, "modernity" refers roughly to the last four centuries, a time that saw the rise of the scientific revolution, market economies, industrialized production,
and mass democracy. Such developments radically altered the world, producing, for many, a disorienting experience of rupture with tradition and the past. All, to
be sure, in the name of progress, for the Enlightenment regarded modernity as a fundamentally moral project, one that would reduce human suffering by means of
science and technology, increase the authority of reason in public life, and extend individual rights to ever more classes of people. At the same time, however, the
Enlightenment cast unacknowledged shadows of its own making: distinctively modern ills like colonial exploitation, mechanized warfare, and widespread feel-
ings of rootlessness and anomie. Progress and good bound up so tightly with loss and evil, it is no wonder that modernity struck (and still strikes) many living
through it as a "problem": is modernity a good, but unfinished, project? Or is it, rather, some kind of fateful error, which will lead to the devastation of the natural
world without, and human nature within? Will it make us freer and our lives more meaningful? Or is the freedom it promises chimerical? And can life any longer
have real meaning in an impersonal world dominated by mass culture and technology? Such anxious doubts haunt modernity, and late 19th and early 20th-centu-
ry texts that give them forceful expression will be the focus of this tutorial, including: Freud's Civilization and its Discontents, Dostoevsky's Notes from Under-
ground, Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Nietzsche's The Genealogy of Morals, Horkheimer and Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment, James' The Portrait of a
Lady, Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, and Beckett's Endgame.

ENGL 351(F) What Are You Laughing At? (Humor In Art) (Same as ArtS 236)
In this course we will discuss and explore humor as an artistic tool in visual art and its unique effectiveness in dealing with difficult subject matter. This partial
survey will focus on the meeting place of socio-political issues and the artist's life. Using basic psychoanalytical texts, art theory and common sense as our
analytical tools, we will figure out why and how humor, in its various permutations, has been used to talk about anything from genocide to personal angst. Some
of the artists we'll look at are Francisco Goya, Philip Guston, Maurizio Cattelan, Paul McCarthy, Bruce Nauman, Nathalie Djunberg, David Shrigley, Nedko
Solakov, Tami Ben Tor Danica Phelps, Guy Ben-Ner and Dan Perjovschi. Reading will include Andr Breton, Sigmund Freud, Dave Hickey, Andrea Fraser,

A study of recent American fiction since World War II. The main topic will be the shift from modern to postmodern narration, and the uses of experiments in
narration for discriminating private and public craziness. We shall be reading Joseph Heller's Catch-22, Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire, Thomas Pynchon's The
Crying of Lot 49, Denis Johnson's Jesus's Son, Toni Morrison's Beloved, Don DeLillo's White Noise, and Raymond Carver's What We Talk About When We Talk

ENGL 359T(F) Twentieth-Century Poetry (W)
This tutorial focuses on poems by W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, W. H. Auden, Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Lowell and Derek Walcott. We
will examine connections among the poets, questions of influence, the significance of tradition and kinds of formal innovations, the meanings of "modernism"
and its aftermath. Our emphasis will be on individual poems, including some longer poems such as Eliot's Four Quartets, Walcott's Omeros, and Stevens's
"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction." Supplementary reading includes essays by these writers on the conception and practice of poetry, as well as literary criticism
of particular poets or poems.

ENGL 360(F) James Joyce's "Ulysses"
This course will explore in depth the demanding and exhilarating work widely regarded as the most important novel of the twentieth century, James Joyce's
Ulysses, which both dismantled the traditional novel and revitalized the genre by opening up new possibilities for fiction. We will discuss the ways in which
compelling issues of character and theme (e.g., questions of heroism and betrayal, humor and self-irony, sexuality and the politics of gender, civic engagement
and artistic isolation, British imperialism and Irish nationalism), are placed in counterpoint with patterns drawn from myth, theology, philosophy, and other litera-
ture, and will consider the convergence of such themes in an unorthodox form of comedy. In assessing Ulysses as the outstanding paradigm of modernist fiction,
we will be equally attentive to its radical and often funny innovations of structure, style, and narrative perspective. Students unfamiliar with Joyce's novel A
Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, which introduces characters later followed in Ulysses, are urged to read it in advance of the course.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, a midterm exam, two papers, and final exam.

ENGL 362(S) From "The Quiet Man" to "The Cripple of Inishmaan": Irish Literature after Yeats and Joyce
In the sixty years since Ireland officially became a Republic, the country has undergone extraordinary transformations: from a poor rural economy to the wealth of
the "Celtic Tiger"; from an ethnically and culturally insular Catholic state (in which censorship was routine), to an assertively outward-looking and increasingly
multicultural nation. This course will begin by considering the effects of decolonization and political independence, and the continuing influence of earlier cultur-
al nationalism, on the work of Irish writers of the 1940s through the 1960s, including texts by Kavanagh, Behan, Beckett and others. We will then turn to the
remarkably fertile literary and creative environment of recent years, in which Irish writers and filmmakers have renewed and extended the traditional concerns of
the Irish literary canon with an increasingly joyous embrace of influences from other traditions and of the hybridizing impacts of postmodernism. Our readings
will include poetry by Seamus Heaney, Evan Boland, Michael Longley, Derek Mahon, Medbh McGuckian, Paul Muldoon; plays by Brian Friel, Frank McGui-
ness, Martin McDonagh, Marina Carr; fiction by Samuel Beckett, James Plunkett, William Trevor, Edna O'Brien, Neil Jordan; the films The Quiet Man, The
Commitments, Butcher Boy and Six Shooter; and episodes of the scurrilous, iconoclastic t.v. comedy Father Ted.

ENGL 364(S) Classical Hollywood Cinema
This course addresses the "Golden Age" of Hollywood cinema, the 1930's and 1940's, when Hollywood set the stylistic and narrative norms for mainstream
cinema and turned out more films, of a higher general quality, than at any other time in its history. We will survey this enormous and varied cultural outpouring
mainly by exploring several of the film genres into which films of the period were organized: the gangster film, the Western, the screwball comedy, film noir, and
the melodrama (e.g., respectively, Scarface, Stagecoach, Bringing Up Baby, The Maltese Falcon, and Gaslight). Some attention will also be given to tracking the
work of individual "authors" or directors (e.g., Ford, Hawks, Lubitsch), and analyzing the nature of the star system in general and the cultural significance of
particular stars (e.g., Humphrey Bogart, Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn, John Wayne, Ingrid Bergman). Theoretical and critical readings will be chosen to illumi-
nate these approaches to film study. This course will require a substantial commitment of time for the frequent mandatory screenings and the regular reading
assignments.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, two papers, a midterm, and a final exam. About 15 pages of writing.

What norms or conventions inform even our most casual interpretive act, and where do they come from? What forms of pleasure and what forms of responsibility
are entailed in reading and viewing, and how does interpretation bear on questions of sexual and political desire? What is the relation between aesthetic works and
history? Although we will range beyond these authors, we will focus especially on the writing of Jacques Derrida, Luce Irigaray, Giorgio Agamben and Walter
Benjamin. In order to keep our own activities as readers at the forefront, we will enter into the critical fray by way of a variety of specific literary texts and films,
including novels by Virginia Woolf, Margaret Duras, and Roberto Bolao, poetry by Alexander Pope, Emily Dickinson, and Sylvia Plath, films by Werner Her-
zog and Billy Wilder.

ENGL 380(F) The Art of Modern Crisis
The first half of the twentieth century was marked by extraordinary social and political upheaval. The same era witnessed a feverishly creative revolution in the
nature and the strategies of artistic representation. In this course we will examine what these two kinds of crisis have to do with one another: how a wide range of
startling innovations in literary and cinematic art may be seen as responses to the particular pressures of the historical crises they represent. Focusing mainly on
British and American instances, but also on works from France and Russia, we will study such diverse historical crises as the spread of anarchism around the turn
of the century; the Bolshevik revolution; the woman's suffrage movement and the emergence of the so-called "New Woman"; World Wars I and II; and the Cold
War. Novels, plays, poems and films will be studied for their distinctive, often dazzling aesthetic strategies for representing these crises, and will include such
works as Jarry's Ubu roi, Bely's Petersburg, Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, poems of Owen and Sassoon, Ford's Parade's End, Eisenstein's Potemkin, Heller's
Catch-22, and Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove.

ENGL 381(S) Black Modernisms and the Great Migration (Same as Africana Studies 380 and American Studies 381)
Courses on "the Harlem Renaissance" have long been standard fare in college curricula, but this rubric is too narrow to encompass the dramatic changes in early
20th century African American culture that made possible the careers of writers like Alain Locke, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Nella Larsen, and Zora
Neale Hurston. Instead, we'll begin with a question: how did the term "urban" became a euphemism for African American culture? A hundred years ago, many
informed commentators scorned the notion that African American populations might become other than what they had been for centuries--overwhelmingly rural
and Southern. The massive social phenomenon that changed this status, by which millions of impoverished workers sought new lives in the industrial cities of the
North, Midwest, and West Coast, is arguably the most significant event in African American history in the 20th century, and has become known as "the Great
Migration." (Or, the Great Migrations' scholars like to pluralize everything these days--it's complicated!)
"Black modernisms" should take the plural, too: as we'll see, the concept of modernism in Euro-American culture depended on a racialized theory of history and
civilization that consigned people of color to the past (or, occasionally, the future), even as it was irrevocably shaped by influences of, appropriations from, and
collaboration with peoples of color who saw modernity as a chance they were determined to claim for themselves. What became known as "the Harlem Renais-
sance" was the most famous U.S. example of such a cultural movement, but we'll explore it in a longer and more aesthetically, politically, and regionally diverse
context. The artists and critics we'll examine, in addition to those mentioned above, may include Hubert Harrison, Jean Toomer, Marita Bonner, Richard Bruce
Nugent, Bessie Smith, Richard Wright, David Levering Lewis, Cheryl Wall, and Brent Hayes Edwards.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: class participation, frequent short writing assignments, a midterm take-home exam, and a final project.

ENGL 383(F) Theorizing Pluralisms (Same as Africana Studies 383 and American Studies 383) (D)
The U.S. has never been a racially, culturally or ethnically homogeneous society, nor is it particularly unusual in this regard. Why, then, is diversity typically
invoked as if it were novel or unprecedented? Why is pluralism presumed to be an exceptionally American ideal, as if no other society, past or present, has sought
to build order upon difference? Why are contemporary debates over multiculturalism so often disconnected from the existence and reproduction of patterns of
social inequality?
This course seeks to provide some of the historical context and intellectual depth too often lacking in these debates. Rather than presuming a simple, singular
"multiculturalism" one may be either "for" or "against," we'll examine a variety of 20th-century theoretical formulations of pluralism emerging in and across
U.S. domains, and consider how present-day multiculturalisms bear the legacies of both imperialist and anti-imperialist aspirations. Readings may be drawn from
liberal social science, Marxist internationalism, Third World radicalism, women of color feminism, and recent cultural studies. This EDI course follows a "Criti-
cal Theorization" focus, aiming to provide resources to students with experience or interest in practical engagement with questions of diversity, both on and
beyond the campus.

ENGL 411(S) Staging Identities: Selfhood, Theatricality and Performance in Twentieth Century Drama
The construction of selfhood is always to some extent a performative act--"All the world's a stage /And all the men and women merely players" as Shake-
speare's Jacques famously remarks. And that performance is inherently dual, since constituted both for the audience of the wider social world and for the `self'
who seeks to act. Drama as a genre, with its constant negotiation of the competing claims of illusion and the operations of reality, has invariably been centrally
interested in the exploration of social identity, in the tensions between public and private selfhood, and in the functions of 'performance'. In this course we will
examine theatre's response to the challenge of self- fashioning in the modern era, and consider the wider ontological status of performance as a category within
the context of twentieth century drama and theatrical staging. Readings will include plays by Chekhov, Pirandello, Beckett, Churchill, Pinter, Walcott, Mamet,
Stoppard, Lori-Parks, Friel and others, along with selected criticism, theory, and psychoanalytical writings.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: two papers totaling about 14 pages, several short responses, active participation in discussion.

ENGL 414(S) Poetry and Prose of John Donne (W)
"Wit!--Wonder-exciting vigour, intenseness and peculiarity of thought," Samuel Coleridge wrote, "this is the wit of Donne!" There is no greater, more daring or
more witty, writer of love poems, divine poems, or religious prose in the English language. Donne wrote in a wide variety of classical genres: elegy, epigram,
satire, love lyric, epithalamion or marriage song, verse epistle, holy sonnet, hymn, familiar letter, meditation, sermon. Yet he constantly reinvigorated convention-
al language with "new-made idiom," turning traditional forms to unpredictable ends.This intensive, discussion-oriented seminar will explore the following ques-
tions. What are the characteristics of Donne's style, and how does his writing evolve over his career? What was the impact of his coterie audience? How does
Donne woo his earthy lovers and God in and through verse? To what extent are biography and history pertinent or helpful in understanding Donne's writing?
What made Donne so appealing to T. S. Eliot and the modernists, and more recently, the post-modernists? What are the compelling issues in contemporary Donne
criticism?
Format: seminar/tutorial. Requirements: In the first half of the semester, students will write short, journal entries as we survey Donne's writing. After spring
vacation, we will break into tutorials to discuss drafts of the 15-20 page seminar paper. The class will then reconvene to discuss revised seminar papers.

ENGL 416(S) Adorno
Theodor Adorno was one of the twentieth century's most challenging thinkers--a German Jewish refugee who loathed the United States but ended up in Los
Angeles, who had no hope for Germany but returned there after the war. His intellectual contributions are too extensive to list: He produced groundbreaking work
in philosophy, musicology, literary criticism, sociology, and political theory. The last book he ever wrote was called Aesthetic Theory and summed up a lifetime of
thinking about what had happened to art in the twentieth century. Its questions will be our questions: What is the responsibility of art in the face of suffering? What
kind of art is possible in a world reduced to rubble? Is it possible to produce a form of art that does not dominate others, that cannot be put in the service of their
domination? A word about the course's format: Aesthetic Theory is one of those rare books that can change the way you think about nearly everything. You can
almost feel your brain shifting into a higher gear as you read it. It is also a book almost impossible to read on your own. So we will be reading Adorno together in
class, actually going through the book sentence by sentence. There will therefore be much less homework than is usual in an advanced seminar, but we will have
to meet every weekday. If you care about music, literature, or the arts, Adorno will floor you.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: Students will write a 20-page seminar paper in close consultation with the professor.

amorous posture, fanaticism is universally decried and never avowed. But what is fanaticism, and why should it be considered such a threat, particularly during a
period that for the most part embraced an enlightened secular rationalism? In this course, we will explore these questions by considering literary texts that drama-
tize fanaticism in light of accounts by such philosophers and historians as Voltaire, Kant, Rousseau, Hobbes, Hume, Burke, Tocqueville, Carlyle, Mill, William
James, and Adorno. Literary readings will be drawn from works by Swift, Wordsworth, Hogge, Dickens, Eliot, Hawthorne, Conrad, and Henry James. We will
also look at drawings and engravings by Hogarth and Goya. While some of these works oppose to fanaticism a capacity for sympathy, self-examination, and
political flexibility, others ascribe it to the self-contradictory tenets of nineteenth-century literary realism and political liberalism. Since fanaticism has recently had
considerable political currency, we will also consider some contemporary accounts, by Walter Laqueur and others, which reanimate the debates and concerns of
the course.
Format: discussion/ seminar. Requirements: Students will write one 6- to 8-page paper and one 10- to 15-page paper.
Prerequisites: a 100-level and a 300-level English course. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Preference given to junior and senior English majors.
(1700-1900 or criticism)
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W SOKOLSKY
ENGL 434(F) William Blake
In this course we will study the illuminated works of the poet and printmaker William Blake. Our texts will include Songs of Innocence and Experience, The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell, Visions of the Daughters of Albion, America, Europe, and Jerusalem, all of which we will read in facsimile editions. We will also
read a range of historical and critical materials. Our discussions will attempt to articulate and explore the particular ways in which Blake's books challenge us as
readers of literature, as consumers of cultural products, and as political thinkers.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: frequent informal short writing assignments, one 5-page, and one longer paper (10-15 pages), preceded by confer-
ence.
Prerequisites: one 300-level English course or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected:10). Preference given to junior and senior English majors.

(See under COMP 401 for full description.) CASSIDAY
(Criticism)
ENGL 450(F) Herman Melville and Mark Twain
Despite their profound differences in literary style and personal temperament, Heman Melville and Mark Twain had much in common. Both gained national
popularity through their travel writings, both were acute and critical observers of American Political life, and both were adventurous innovators in the craft of
prose fiction. Melville, however, spurned his own success and alienated his readers with a series of complex, difficult, and unsettling novels. Mark Twain, on the
other hand, expanded his popularity with astonishing effectiveness. This course will examine and compare the works and careers of these writers. A comparative
approach to works such as Benito Cereno and Puddn'head Wilson, satirical works addressing slavery and racial attitudes, should be illuminating. On the other
hand, we will also attend to the traits that make these writers such singular literary artists.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: one short paper of 5 to 7 pages and a final paper of about 15 pages.
Prerequisites: a 300-level English course, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). (1700-1900)

CREATIVE WRITING COURSES
Students interested in taking a creative writing course should preregister and be sure to attend the first class meeting. Class size is limited; final selections will
be made by the instructor shortly after the first class meeting. Preregistration does not guarantee a place in the class. Students with questions should consult the
appropriate instructor.
ENGL 239(S) The Long, Short, and Extreme In-between
It takes a certain finesse to craft the vibrations in Gwendolyn Brooks' 8 line, 24 word poem "We Real Cool," or to create Ezra Pound's crisp 2-line vignette "In a
Station of the Metro". At the other end of the spectrum, how does one establish a singularity of vision and sustain the voice necessary for lengthy poems and
projects? Notable examples are Larry Levis' enchanting and winding elegies and David St. John's novella in verse, "The Face."
This class is primarily a creative writing course in which we will be focusing on some poetic "extremes" --very long and very short poems-that challenge what
we think of both poetry and the page. To undertake our own creative writing work, we will be examining certain poems and their methods to understand how
these different lengths and forms build their own effectiveness and instruct us how to read them. Do we stick with two lines, or go the distance, page upon page?
And if we go with a middle ground, what kind of reinvention can we give that recognizable space? We will also be looking at other less common forms and
projects like curtal sonnets or double-jointed hinge poems.
The class will be a mix of readings, discussions, and our own poetic production in imitation of some of these "extremes". Readings will include individual poetry
collections, selected poems, and essay handouts. Readings are likely to be drawn from the works of Richard Hugo, Tony Hoagland, Larry Levis, Denise Duha-
mel, David St. John, Galway Kinnell, Claudia Rankine, among others.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: regular attendance, participation in class discussions and workshops, several short exercises, and a substantial final
creative exercise.
Prerequisite: a 100-level English course. Enrollment limit: 15. In the event of over-enrollment, preference is given to students with prior creative writing experi-
ence.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR BERTRAM
ENGL 281(F) The Writing of Poetry
A workshop in the writing of poetry. Weekly assignments and regular conferences with the instructor will be scheduled. Students will discuss each other's poems
in the class meetings.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit:15 (expected: 15). Preference given to students who have preregistered; selection will be based on writing samples and/or
conferences with the instructor.
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR RAAB
ENGL 282(S) Poetry Through Translation
A workshop in the writing of poetry using some of the techniques and strategies of translation. While students with at least a year of foreign language study will be
encouraged to work directly from the original, no prior knowledge of a foreign language is required. Exercises will include the adaptation of a classical poem to a
more contemporary idiom, work on new versions of previously translated poems, the alteration of a poem's voice and imagery to affect its dramatic context, and
the creation of original poems through imitation. Specific emphasis will be given to stylistic and tonal choices made in the translation process. Successful comple-
tion of the course will serve as a prerequisite for advanced workshops in poetry.
Format: workshop. Requirements: weekly assignments and regular conferences with the instructor will be scheduled.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected:15). Preference given to students based on writing samples and/or conferences with the instructor.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 TF FILKINS
ENGL 283(F) Introductory Workshop in Fiction

ENGL 385(F) Advanced Fiction Workshop: Form and Technique
A course for students with experience writing fiction and an understanding of the basics of plot, character, setting, and scene. By examining stories in both
traditional and unusual forms, we'll study how a story's significant elements are chosen, ordered, and arranged; how the story is shaped; how, by whom, and to
what purpose it's told. Students will generate new stories for workshop, employing the forms and techniques studied.
Format: discussion class/workshop. Requirements: active participation in workshop and written assignments, including weekly brief responses to assigned sto-
ries; two story drafts for discussion in workshop; a final portfolio of two revised, polished stories.
Prerequisites: English 283 or 384, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). No preferences.

CONCENTRATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
The Environmental Studies Program, within the liberal arts mission of Williams College, provides students with an opportunity to explore how humans inter-
act with the environment, including physical, biological, philosophical, and social elements. The program is designed so that students will understand the com-
plexity of issues and perspectives and to appreciate that most environmental issues lack distinct disciplinary boundaries. Our goal is to educate students to be
well-informed, environmentally-literate citizens of the planet who have the capacity to become active participants in the local and global community. To this end,
the program is designed to develop the capability to think in interdisciplinary ways and to use synthetic approaches to solve problems while incorporating the
knowledge and experiences gained from majoring in other departments at the College.
The concentration in Environmental Studies allows students to pursue an interdisciplinary study of the environment by taking four core courses and one
elective course in each of the three divisions: natural science, social science, and humanities and arts. Many environmental controversies call upon citizens and
organizations to grasp complex, uncertain science and to address conflicting human values and uneasy ethical choices. In short, the traditional liberal arts are a
necessary but not sufficient preparation for dealing with many environmental issues. Accordingly, the Environmental Studies Program provides students with the
broad educational background needed to analyze complex environmental matters and to fashion pragmatic, feasible solutions.
The program is administered by the Center for Environmental Studies (CES) located, at present, in Harper House. Founded in 1967, CES was one of the first
environmental studies programs at a liberal arts college. In addition to the academic program, CES is the focus of a varied set of activities in which students lead
and participate, often with other members of the Williams community. CES offers extensive resources including library materials and databases, GIS facilities,
and its own funding sources for student-initiated activities, summer research and internships. The Center administers the Hopkins Memorial Forest, a 2,600 acre
natural area northwest of campus, where field-study sites, a laboratory, and passive-recreation opportunities may be found in all seasons. CES also operates an
environmental analysis laboratory at the Science Center.
The Environmental Studies Program has three overlapping components:
 The concentration in Environmental Studies, which consists of a set of seven courses.
 The Four Places goal. (See below.)
 Honors in Environmental Studies; a senior thesis is encouraged but not required.
Concentration Requirements
Seven courses are required: four are core courses to be taken by all students earning the concentration; three are distribution courses to be selected from the lists
below.
Core courses
101 Nature and Society: An Introduction to Environmental Studies
203 Ecology
302 Environmental Planning and Design Workshop
402 Senior Seminar: Ethics and the Environmnent
The core courses are intended to be taken in sequence, although there is some flexibility allowed. Environmental Studies (ENVI) 101 is a broad introduction to
the field, emphasizing the humanities and social sciences. ENVI 203 is a course in ecology (offered in Biology) that provides a unified conceptual approach to the
behavior of living things in the natural world. ENVI 302 puts teams of students to work on planning projects of immediate importance in the Berkshires. ENVI
402, the senior seminar, is an opportunity for concentrators majoring in a wide variety of disciplines to draw together their educational experiences and provide a
personal accounting of how they understand the interdisciplinary character of environmental studies and its connections to their future lives and careers. The core
course structure affords students freedom to explore and to specialize in diverse fields of study, while sustaining a focus on environmental questions throughout
their time at Williams.
An interdisciplinary course emphasizing field science, ENVI 102 (Introduction to Environmental Science), is strongly recommended for all students interested
in the concentration.
Distribution Courses
In order to earn the concentration a student must take one course from each of the following three groups. Courses may be counted both toward the concentra-
tion in Environmental Studies and toward a disciplinary major.
Students can check with the program director to see if other courses not listed here might count as electives.

Variations from the requirements of the concentration must be approved in writing by the director of the program. Students are urged to consult with program
faculty and the director as soon as they develop an interest in the concentration or if they intend to participate in study away opportunities.
In addition to courses fulfilling the concentration requirements, the following electives and related electives are offered:
Environmental Studies 397, 398 Independent Study of Environmental Problems
Environmental Studies 493-W31-494 Senior Research and Thesis
Winter study courses play an important role in the program, offering opportunities to experiment in fields unfamiliar to the student, and for interdisciplinary
topics to be developed by faculty working alone and in teams. Students are urged to review each year's winter study offerings bearing in mind their interests in the
environment.
Rationale for Course Numbering
The numbering sequence of the four required courses reflects the order in which they should be taken, although Environmental Studies 302 may be taken in the
senior or sophomore year if a student is away junior year. Cross-listed courses are assigned the same number as the departmental number whenever possible.
Four Places--A Goal
The human place in natural landscapes is geographic, and learning about particular places is an essential part of environmental studies. By the time each
student in Environmental Studies graduates, she or he should have developed intellectual insight into and personal experience of four places: "Home";
"Here"--the Berkshires; "There"--an alien place; and "The World"--a global perspective. For practical purposes, "There" is a place where the geography is
unusual in the student's experience (e.g., developing country, inner city, arctic), so are the socioeconomic circumstances (for example, per capita income might be
a small fraction of a year's tuition at Williams), and the language is not standard English. Although this goal is not a requirement for the concentration, it is a
significant aspect of the program, and CES resources are aimed in part at enabling all students to meet this goal. For example, students are encouraged to pursue
summer internships in their "Home" communities, or to do semester or winter study courses at locations outside the temperate zones ("There"); field courses in
natural science or history courses emphasizing New England can deepen familiarity with "Here." Students concentrating in Environmental Studies should plan
winter study courses and summer work or study experiences with the Four Places goal in mind, particularly the experiences "There" and at "Home." Courses not
in the list of electives for the concentration may be considered as substitutes, on a case-by-case basis, if they also meet the Four Places goal in a way not otherwise
available in the program. Students should see the program director for further information.
Honors in Environmental Studies
A student earns honors in Environmental Studies by successfully completing a rigorous, original independent research project under the supervision of two or
more members of the faculty, including at least one member of the CES faculty. The research project should be reported and defended both in a thesis and orally.
A student may undertake an honors thesis and submit it to both his or her major department and Environmental Studies; petitions for a joint honors project should
be approved by the department chair and the director of the program no later than the beginning of the student's senior year. Students who pursue honors in
Environmental Studies alone should enroll in Environmental Studies 493-W31-494, Senior Research and Thesis, in addition to completing the requirements for
the concentration.
Because most research requires sustained field, laboratory, or library work that is difficult to combine with conventional coursework, students are strongly
encouraged to spend the summer before senior year doing honors research. Funds to support student research are available from restricted endowments of the
Center, and an open competition is held each spring, to allocate the limited resources. Some departments also provide limited support for summer thesis research.
Students and their faculty sponsors should plan the thesis with the possibility of summer research in mind.
Honors in Environmental Studies will be awarded on the basis of the academic rigor, interdisciplinary synthesis, independence, and originality demonstrated
by the student and in the completed thesis.
STUDY ABROAD
The Program in Environmental Studies encourages its concentrators to study abroad if feasible, and there are a variety of study abroad programs that include
courses and experiential learning about the environment. Students should speak to the chair of the program as early as possible in making their plans in order to
139
confirm what courses abroad will be eligible for credit as an elective course in the concentration. Students may not use study abroad classes to fulfill any of the
program's core course requirements.
ENVI 101(F) Nature and Society: An Introduction to Environmental Studies
This course introduces environmental studies as an interdisciplinary field of learning. Concerned with the complex dynamics of nature-society relations, environ-
mental studies is indispensable to the development of societies that promote the well-being of people, animals and their habitats. Organized around the ecological,
social and ethical knowledges that dominate environmental studies, we explore the nature of this knowledge and its implications for sustainability. We also
examine the evolving history and philosophy of environmental studies, and note how different conceptions of nature, society and interdisciplinarity inform the
field.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation is based on tests, papers and/or projects, as well as active participation in class.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 35.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.
Required course for students wishing to complete the Environmental Studies concentration.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR LYNN
ENVI 102(S) Introduction to Environmental Science
The field of environmental science considers physical, chemical, and biological interactions in an integrated approach to complex environmental systems. This
course introduces students to multidisciplinary scientific methods used to assess and interpret human impacts on the environment. Through hands-on study of
several local sites, we probe five global themes: the carbon cycle and climate change; acid deposition; toxic metals; water quality; and waste treatment. Discus-
sions of case studies from other parts of the world illustrate the global analogues of these local studies. Following these group projects, students design and
complete independent projects in subjects of particular interest to them.
Format: two 75-minute workshop/discussion sessions, and one 4-hour field/laboratory session each week. Evaluation is based on reports of field and laboratory
projects, participation in discussion, and an independent research project.
Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 24). Preference given to first-year students. This course is an introductory science seminar, designed for students who have a
strong interest in Environmental Science. Satisfies one semester of the Division III requirement. This course also satisfies "The Natural World" requirement for

ENVI 208(F) The Challenge of Climate Change: Policy Responses
Climate change has emerged as the keystone environmental issue of this generation--and most likely for many generations to come. It now appears inevitable
that temperatures will increase this century by 23C, though this projection may prove too far too optimistic if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. Under
many scenarios, temperatures could continue to increase in the 22nd Century absent stringent mitigation measures by the global community. This course ex-
amines the international and domestic legal and policy mechanisms to address the threat, including potential longterm responses. While this class will consider
some of the scientific underpinnings for predicted climate impacts, it will focus primarily on the policy options open to individual countries and to the internation-
al community It will also consider the human, ecological, and social dimensions of climate unchecked climate change. The course will culminate in an inclass
simulation of negotiations for a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol.

ENVI 302(F) Environmental Planning Workshop
This interdisciplinary course introduces the theories, methodologies, and legal framework of environmental planning and provides students with experience in the
planning process through project work in the Berkshire region. The first part of the course introduces the students to planning literature through analysis and
discussion of case studies. In the second section of the course students apply their skills to the study of an actual planning problem. Small teams of students,
working in conjunction with a client in the community, research and propose solutions to a local environmental planning problem. The project work draws on
students' academic training, extracurricular activities, and applies interdisciplinary knowledge and methodologies. The course culminates in public presentations
of each team's planning study. This course also includes field trips and computer labs.
Format: discussion/project lab. Requirements: midterm exam, short written exercises, class presentations, public presentations, final group report.
Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 101 and Biology/Environmental Studies 203, or permission of instructors. Enrollment limit: 16. Open to juniors and seniors
only.

ENVI 306(F) Interpreting Nature and Society: The Study of Meaning, Values and Worldviews (W)
This course investigates how we can study human meaning, values and worldviews in environmental studies. It does this via the theory and practice of qualitative
research, a way of knowing that is strikingly different yet complementary to the methods used in the natural sciences. Qualitative research helps us interpret
human thought and action, study the norms and practices of social institutions, and uncover the impact of humanity's 'geographic agency' on wild and humanized
landscapes. In so doing, it helps us apprehend the meaning of humanity's troubled relationship with nature, while providing both causal and normative knowledge
to improve this relationship. The practice of defining, identifying, collecting and interpreting qualitative data is stressed throughout the course.
Format: seminar. Evaluation is based on tests, papers and/or projects, as well as active participation in class.
Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 101 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected:19). Preference to Environmental Studies concentrators.

ENVI 307 Environmental Law (Same as Political Science 317) (Not offered 2009-2010)
We rely on environmental laws to make human communities healthier and protect the natural world, while allowing for sustainable economic growth. Yet, despite
40 years of increasingly varied and complex legislation, balancing human needs and environmental quality has never been harder than it is today.
Environmental Studies 307 analyzes the transformation of environmental law from fringe enterprise to fundamental feature of modern political, economic and
social life. ENVI 307 also addresses the role of community activism in environmental law, from local battles over proposed industrial facilities to national cam-
paigns for improved corporate citizenship.
By the completion of the semester, students will understand both the successes and failures of modern environmental law and how these laws are being rein-
vented, through innovations like pollution credit trading and "green product" certification, to confront globalization, climate change and other emerging threats.
Format: seminar, with guest lecturers. Student-selected midterm paper, final exam and several brief papers on individual readings.
Prerequisites: Political Science 201 and Environmental Studies 101. No enrollment limit (expected: 15).
This course satisfies the "Environmental Policy" requirement for the Environmental Studies concentration.

ENVI 308(F) U.S. Environmental Law and Policy (Same as Political Science 316)
This course provides an introduction to the historical development of environmental policymaking in the United States, as well as key institutions and mecha-
nisms in the policymaking process (scientific, economic and legal), and several current salient issues of environmental policy in the United States, including
implementation of key U.S. environmental legislation and the implications of U.S. environmental policymaking for the global commons and the environment of
other nations. Specific topics will include the respective roles of the executive, legislative and judicial branches in environmental policymaking, key federal
environmental laws, and the role of environmental justice considerations in the policymaking process. The course also emphasizes skills development, including
how to read judicial decisions and statutes, legal research, and public speaking. This class is intended to be complementary with ENVI 309. Although there may be
some slight overlap in topics, the two classes will differ in focus, methodology, and approach.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: short papers, participation, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Environmental Studies 101 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 20). Preference given to Environmental Studies concen-

ENVI 309(S) Understanding Public Policy: Discourses of Science, Politics and Ethics (Same as History of Science 309, Political Science
301 and Science and Technology Studies 309) (W)
This course looks at public policy in light of contemporary turns in policy studies--critical, ethical and interpretive. These turns emphasize the role of agency,
meaning, power, justice and moral values in policy discourse, and are indispensable to understanding what policy is and how it works. They also emphasize that
public policy is not simply what governments do, but is a discursive process involving governments, corporations, civil society and social movements intersecting
at multiple scales. We shall examine some of the theories and methods of this approach, and explore their implications for public policies that impact the well-be-
ing of people, animals and nature. This class is intended to be complementary with ENVI 308. Although there may be some slight overlap in topics, the two classes
will differ in focus, methodology, and approach.
Format: seminar. Evaluation is based on tests, papers and/or projects, as well as active participation in class.

ENVI 328(S) International Environmental Law (Same as Political Science 328)
This class will examine the legal structures and mechanisms that have been created to address international environmental problems --ranging from agreements
between neighboring countries to full-fledged multilateral environmental agreements. The class will consider a number of examples of successful and partly
successful international legal agreements, possibly including the United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty, the CITES convention on trade in endangered species,
and the Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting chemicals. It will also discuss the vexing current negotiations over climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.
The class will consider topics such as: the historical background for international environmental law; the forces affecting success and failure of negotiations;
enforcement mechanisms; compliance and dispute resolution mechanisms.
Format: lecture and discussion. Grading will be based on papers and a final exam.

ENVI 340(S) The Art of Looking: A Course in Creative Non-Fiction Writing (Same as English 369) (W)
This is a course in creative non-fiction nature writing--a genre in which personal reflection and expression are joined with detailed observation of the natural and
built environment.
At the heart of all nature writing lies a steady patience and a long attentive looking. "To learn something new," said the naturalist John Burroughs, "take the path
today that you took yesterday." This is not easy advice for most of us, drawn as we are to novelty and distraction. But over the course of the semester we will try to
follow it, returning again and again to the same spot of campus, to look, to listen, to slow down, to pay attention, both alone and in each other's company. The
course will be structured around a set of readings by well-known nature writers, which will serve as a focus for classroom discussion. All participants will be
asked to keep "seed-books" and journals of their own and to write at least three original essays, which will be re-worked and polished over the course of the
semester.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three essays, regular class attendance, and participation in discussions.
Prerequisite: Environmental Studies 101 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: about 15). Preference to Environmental Studies concen-

FIRST-YEAR RESIDENTIAL SEMINAR
The First-Year Residential Seminar is a program designed to help students explore new ways of integrating their social and intellectual lives. Students who
participate live together in the same residential unit, and take the seminar together during the fall semester. Enrollment in the seminar is restricted to students in the
program. The seminar explores topics and issues that can be expected to promote lively discussions both in and out of class. It may be team-taught and may
contain interdisciplinary subject matter.
All entering first-year students have the opportunity to express interest in participating ; if more students are interested than there are spaces available, selection
is done randomly. Participants must commit themselves to taking FRS 101.
FRS 101(F) Interpreting Human Experience (W)
How we make sense of the world, and of our lives, depends to a considerable degree on the intellectual methodologies we apply to the task of interpretation.
Freud, for instance, saw selfhood and perception as fundamentally determined by the structures of the psyche itself; Marx, by contrast, argued that our sense of
reality is conditioned primarily by our material and social circumstances; more recently, historian of science Thomas Kuhn has emphasized that the underlying
assumptions which shape the very questions we pose as thinkers significantly influence and limit what data, and thus what reality, we are most likely to observe.
This course aims to provide a foundational experience for the liberal arts education, by engaging with key religious, political, literary, anthropological, philosophi-
cal and psychoanalytic texts with a view to complicating our sense of the purposes and possibilities of intellectual life and confronting the challenges of epis-
temology. Readings will include works by Plato, John Stuart Mill, Marx, E.M. Forster, Freud, Rousseau, Richard Dawkins, Brecht, Dangarembga, and extracts
from the Bible and the Qur'an. In keeping with the aims of the FRS program, the course is intended to foster productive connections between what we discuss and
debate in class and your broader experiences as students. The course will invite and promote interdisciplinary connections between core ways of seeing and
interpreting the world, with a strong emphasis on improving your critical skills.
Format: seminar; students who participate live together in the same residential unit, and take the seminar together during the fall semester. Requirements: regular
short writing assignments designed to hone your reading skills; four papers ranging from 3-5 pages; and active contribution to discussion.
Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Enrollment limited to FRS students.

MAJOR
The Geosciences major is designed (1) to provide an understanding of the physical and biological evolution of our planet and its interacting global systems, (2)
to help us learn to live in harmony with our environment, and (3) to appreciate our place within the vastness of Earth history. Forces within the Earth are responsi-
ble for the development of mountain ranges and ocean basins. Waves, running water, and glaciers have shaped the surface of the Earth, providing the landscapes
we see today. Fossils encased in sedimentary rocks supply evidence for the evolution of life and help to record the history of the Earth.
Students who graduate with a major in Geosciences from Williams can enter several different fields of geoscience or can use their background in other careers.
Students who have continued in the geosciences are involved today, especially after graduate training, in environmental fields ranging from hydrology to earth-
quake prediction, in the petroleum and mining industries, federal and state geological surveys, geological consulting firms, and teaching and research in universi-
ties, colleges, and secondary schools. Graduates who have entered business or law have also found many applications for their geoscience background. Other
graduates now in fields as diverse as art and medicine pursue their interest in the out-of-doors with a deeper appreciation for the natural world around them.
The Geosciences major sequence includes, after any 100-level course, five designated advanced courses, and three elective courses.
Sequence Courses (required of majors)
GEOS 201 Geomorphology
GEOS 202 Mineralogy and Geochemistry
GEOS 301 Structural Geology
GEOS 302 Sedimentology
GEOS 401 Stratigraphy
Elective courses may be clustered to provide concentrations in selected fields. Suggested groupings are listed below as guidelines for course selections, but
other groups are possible according to the interests of the students. Departmental advisors are given for the different fields of Geosciences.
I Environmental Geoscience. For students interested in surface processes and the application of geology to environmental problems such as land use plan-
ning, resource planning, environmental impact analysis, and environmental law. Such students should also consider enrolling in the coordinate program of the
Center for Environmental Studies.
GEOS/ENVI 103 Global Warming and Natural Disasters
GEOS/ENVI/MAST 104 Oceanography
GEOS/ENVI 206 Renewable Energy and the Sustainable Campus
GEOS/ENVI 214 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems
GEOS/ENVI 215 Climate Changes
GEOS/ENVI 218T The Carbon Cycle and Climate
(Students interested in Environmental Geosciences should consult with Professors Dethier or Cook.)
II Oceanography, Stratigraphy and Sedimentation. For students interested in the study of modern and ancient sedimentary environments and the marine
organisms that inhabited them.
GEOS 101/ENVI 105 Biodiversity in Geologic Time
GEOS/ENVI/MAST 104 Oceanography
GEOS/ENVI 206 Renewable Energy and the Sustainable Campus
GEOS 212/BIOL 211 Invertebrate Paleobiology
GEOS/ENVI 253T Coral Reefs
(Students interested in Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation should consult with Professors M. Johnson or Cox.)
III The Solid Earth. For students interested in plate tectonics, the processes active within the Earth, the origin and deformation of rocks and minerals, and
mineral exploration.
GEOS 102 An Unfinished Planet
GEOS 105 Geology Outdoors
GEOS 303 Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology
GEOS 360T Geology of the Appalachias
(Students interested in The Solid Earth should consult with Professors Wobus or Karabinos.)
With the consent of the department, certain courses at the 200 level or higher in biology, chemistry, mathematics and statistics, or physics may be substituted
for elective courses in the major. Credit may be granted in the Geosciences major for American Maritime Studies 211/Geosciences 210 (Oceanographic Pro-
cesses) or American Maritime Studies 311/Biology 231 (Marine Ecology) taken at Mystic Seaport.
Students considering graduate work in geosciences should also take courses in the allied sciences and mathematics in addition to the requirements of the
Geosciences major. The selection of outside courses will depend on the field in which a student intends to specialize. Most geoscience graduate schools require a
year of chemistry and mathematics through 105. For those going into Environmental Geoscience, courses in computer science or statistics are recommended. For
those considering Oceanography, Stratigraphy, and Sedimentation, Biology 102 and Biology 203 are suggested. For students entering Solid-Earth fields, Physics
131 and 132 are recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN GEOSCIENCES
In order to be recommended for the degree with honors, a student is expected to have completed at least two semesters and a winter study project (031) of
independent research culminating in a thesis which demonstrates outstanding achievement of an original and innovative nature. The principal considerations in
admitting a student to a program of independent research are mastery of fundamental material and skills, ability to pursue independent study successfully, and
demonstrated student interest and motivation.
Further advice on the major can be obtained from the department chair.
STUDY ABROAD
Students planning on studying abroad should meet as early as possible with the Department Chair to plan study-abroad courses and to discuss how potential
courses might be used in the Geosciences major. In recent years students have found that courses offered by universities in New Zealand, particularly the Univer-
sity of Otago, provide an excellent complement to courses offered at Williams. Courses offered at Norwegian Technical Universities and at several universities in
the United Kingdom have also been accepted as part of the Geosciences major. Many other study-abroad programs, however, do not usually offer courses that are
acceptable substitutes for courses required by the Williams Geoscience major.
GEOS 101 Biodiversity in Geologic Time (Same as Environmental Studies 105) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Is planet Earth now undergoing the most severe mass extinction of species ever to have occurred during its 4.5-billion-year history? By some calculations, the
expanding population of a single species is responsible for the demise of 74 species per day. This provocative question is addressed by way of the rock and fossil
record as it relates to changes in biodiversity through deep geologic time before the appearance of Homo sapiens only 250,000 years ago. Long before human
interaction, nature conducted its own experiments on the complex relationship between evolving life and changes in the physical world. This course examines
ways in which wandering continents, shifting ocean basins, the rise and fall of mountains, the wax and wane of ice sheets, fluctuating sea level, and even crashing
asteroids all shaped major changes in global biodiversity. Particular attention is drawn to the half dozen most extensive mass extinctions and what factors may
have triggered them. Equal consideration is given to how the development of new ecosystems forever altered the physical world. How and when did the earliest
microbes oxygenate the atmosphere? Do the earliest multicellular animals from the late Precambrian portray an architectural experiment doomed to failure?
What factors contributed to the explosive rise in biodiversity at the start of the Cambrian Period? What explanation is there for the sudden appearance of verte-
brates? How and when did plants colonize the land? What caused the demise of the dinosaurs? Is the present dominance of mammals an accident of nature? The
answers to these and other questions are elusive, but our wise stewardship of the planet and its present biodiversity may depend on our understanding of the past.
Concepts of plate tectonics and island biogeography are applied to many aspects of the puzzle.
Format: lecture; one laboratory per week (some involving field work); plus one all-day field trip to the Helderberg Plateau and Catskill Mountains of New York.
Evaluation will be based on weekly quizzes and lab work, a midterm exam, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 20).

GEOS 102(S) An Unfinished Planet
The Earth is a work-in-progress, an evolving planet whose vital signs--as expressed by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and shifting plates--are still strong. In a
geological time frame, nothing on Earth is permanent: ocean basins open and close, mountains rise and fall, continental masses accrete and separate. There is a
message here for all who live, for an infinitesimally brief time, on the moving surface of the globe. This course uses the plate tectonics model--one of the
fundamental scientific accomplishments of this century--to interpret the processes and products of a changing Earth. The emphasis will be on mountain systems
(on land and beneath the oceans) as expressions of plate interactions. Specific topics include the rocks and structures of modern and ancient mountain belts, the
patterns of global seismicity and volcanism, the nature of the Earth's interior, the changing configurations of continents and ocean basins through time, and, in
some detail, the formation of the Appalachian Mountain system and the geological assembly of New England. Readings will be from a physical geology textbook
and primary source supplement, selected writings of John McPhee, and references about the geology of the Northeast.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; lab (several involving field work), two hours per week; one required all-day field trip during the last week of the semester to
the Connecticut Valley and the highlands of western Massachusetts. Evaluation will be based on two hour-tests, weekly lab work, and a scheduled final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Preference to first- and second-year students.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-3 W WOBUS
GEOS 103(F) Global Warming and Natural Disasters (Same as Environmental Studies 103)
The destruction caused by recent hurricanes such as Katrina, devastation of prolonged drought in the African Sahel, catastrophic flooding and mudslides in
Indonesia and sea level encroachment on the Alaska coast are visible examples of natural disasters that may be modulated by climate change. Reports from the
World Bank conclude that global climate change, together with environmental degradation and urbanization, has the potential to increase the severity and impact
of natural disasters. In this course we globally examine geological and climatological processes that "set up" natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, land-
slides, droughts, extreme temperatures, and coastal surges, as well as the processes that condition availability of water resources. We study in detail the causes and
anticipated consequences of human alteration of climate and its impact on the spectrum of natural hazards and resources. During laboratory sessions we use local
field sites and computer models to analyze recent disasters/hazards and options for mitigating future impacts and study trends in weather and climate.
Format: lectures, 3 hours per week; laboratory, 2 hours per week. Evaluation based on written reports from laboratories, two hour exams and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 24 (expected 24). Preference to first- and second-year students.
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF Lab: 1-3 M,W COOK and DETHIER
GEOS 104(S) Oceanography (Same as Environmental Studies 104 and Maritime Studies 104)
In this integrated introduction to the oceans we will examine formation and history of the ocean basins; the composition and origin of seawater; currents, tides, and
waves; ocean-atmosphere interactions; oceans and climate; deep-marine environments; coastal processes; productivity in the oceans; and marine resources.
Coastal oceanography will be investigated on an all-day field trip, hosted by the Salty Ephs of the Williams-Mystic program in Connecticut.
Lectures and discussions, three hours per week; one two-hour laboratory in alternate weeks; one all-day field trip. Evaluation will be based on two hour exams,
lab work, oral presentation of an oceanographic topic, participation in the field trip, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 60 (expected: 60). Preference to first-year students.
This course may not be taken pass-fail. Students who have taken GEOS 210/MAST 211 (at Williams-Mystic) may not take GEOS 104 for credit.
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-3 M,T COX
GEOS 105(F) Geology Outdoors (W)
An introduction to geology through student field projects. The mountains, lakes, rivers, and valleys of the Williamstown area provide unusual opportunities for
learning geology in the field. Student projects will include the study of streams as active agents of erosion and deposition, the effects of glaciation on the New
England landscape, and the history of mountain building in the Appalachians. Following several group projects introducing the techniques of field geology,
students will pursue independent projects on subjects of particular interest to them. This course departs from the standard science course format with three lectures
and a required lab each week. Instead, emphasis is placed on learning through active participation in field projects and presentation of results through high quality
writing. The class will meet two afternoons each week from 1:00 to 3:45 p.m. There will be two all day field trips. This course is designed for students who have a
serious interest in geology or other natural and environmental sciences, the outdoors, and writing.
Format: discussion/field laboratory, six hours per week. Evaluation will be based on participation in field work and discussions, five 8-page papers based on field
projects, and an oral presentation of independent projects. Students will use detailed comments on their papers to improve their writing style in successive assign-
ments.
No prerequisites; no previous knowledge of geology required. Open only to first-year students. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected:10).

GEOS 206(S) Renewable Energy and the Sustainable Campus (Same as Environmental Studies 206)
Rising oil and electricity costs disrupt the economy and help fuel global insecurity. Clearer understanding of how fossil-fuel consumption contributes to global
climate change is increasing demand for renewable sources of energy and for more sustainable campus environments. What sources of energy will supply Wil-
liams College and nearby areas in the twenty-first century? How will campus buildings, old and new, continue to be attractive spaces while making far more
efficient use of heat and light? This course is a practical introduction to renewable sources of energy, including conservation, and to their application to the campus
environment. Topics covered include: biological sources of energy (biomass, biogas, liquid fuels), wind energy, geothermal and solar energy, energy efficiency
and the environmental impacts of using renewable energy. Lectures, field trips and individual projects emphasize examples from the campus and nearby area.
Format: seminar, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on an hour exam, class participation that includes a seminar presentation, and a research project
that investigates some aspect of campus energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions.

GEOS 212 Invertebrate Paleobiology (Same as Biology 211) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This course offers an introduction to the study of prehistoric life. The fossils of marine invertebrates provide an excellent foundation for this purpose, because they
are widespread and abundant, they are often well-preserved, and they have a record that reaches back in time over 600 million years. The intellectual discovery of
fossils as organic relics and the ways in which fossils were used by earlier generations to support conflicting views on nature are briefly surveyed. The lecture
topics that follow are organized to illustrate the various directions explored by paleontologists today to solve a broad range of questions. These include: biological
and paleontological views on the species concept relevant to taxonomy; ongoing debate over the timing and mechanisms of evolution; biostratigraphy as a means
to correlate sedimentary rocks; functional morphology as a means to reconstruct the biomechanics of extinct species; analysis of fossil assemblages to interpret
the ecology of ancient environments; paleogeography as related to patterns in biodiversity, and the possible causes of mass extinctions. Laboratory exercises
utilize superb fossil collections to study the processes of fossilization and to survey the biology and taxonomy of the major invertebrate phyla.
Format: lecture/laboratory; field trip to the Lower Devonian Helderbergs of New York State. Evaluation will be based on weekly lab reports, a midterm paper, a
midterm exam, a lab practicum, and a final exam.

GEOS 214 Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (Same as Environmental Studies 214) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be
offered 2010-2011)
Remote sensing involves the collection and processing of data from satellite and airborne sensors to yield environmental information about the Earth's surface
and lower atmosphere. Remote sensing enhances regional mapping of rock types and faults and analysis of vegetation cover and land-use changes over time. A
Geographic Information System (GIS) links satellite-based environmental measurements with spatial data such as topography, transportation networks, and polit-
ical boundaries, allowing display and quantitative analysis at the same scale using the same geographic reference. This course covers the principles and practice of
remote-data capture and geographic rectification using a Global Positioning System (GPS), as well as the concepts of Remote Sensing, including linear and
non-linear image enhancements, convolution filtering, principle components analysis, and classification. Principles of GIS include display and classification,
spatial buffers, and logical overlays. Weekly labs focus on practical applications of these techniques to data from Hopkins Memorial Forest, the Berkshire region,
and other areas of North America.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, weekly.
Prerequisites: at least one introductory course in Biology, Environmental Studies, or Geosciences. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Preference given to sopho-
mores and juniors.

GEOS 215 Climate Changes (Same as Environmental Studies 215) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
In recent years, there has been a growing public and scientific interest in the Earth's climate and its variability. This interest reflects both concern over future
climate changes that may result from anthropogenic increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases and growing recognition of the economic impact of "natural"
climate variability (for example, El Nio events), especially in the developing world. Efforts to understand the Earth's climate system and predict future climate
changes require both study of parameters controlling present day climate and detailed studies of climate changes in the past. In this course, we will review the
processes that control the Earth's climate, like insolation, distribution of heat, ocean circulation, and the greenhouse effect. At the same time, we will review the
geological record of climate changes in the past, examining their causes, positive and negative feedback effects, and indicators of the stability or instability of the
climate system.
Format: lecture/ laboratory/discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problems (25%), two hour exams (50%), and a final project
(25%) where students will collect, analyze, and interpret data. Weekly laboratory exercises will emphasize developing problem solving skills and using quantita-
tive analyses to assess if a given explanation is possible and reasonable. These exercises will include developing and applying numerical models of the carbon
cycle and basic radiative balance models.
Prerequisites: 100-level course in Geoscience, Biology, Chemistry, or Physics or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference to
Geoscience majors.

GEOS 217T Planetary Geology (Same as Astronomy 217T) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
The diversity of our solar system is incredible. No two plants are exactly alike, and as we acquire more data and higher-resolution images, our sense of wonder
grows. However, we can't hike around and hammer rocks on Venus or Titan, so we have to infer composition, form, texture and process from remotely-captured
images and sparse chemical and spectral data. This leaves plenty of room for interpretation and hypothesising about geological processes on other bodies.
Through reading recent research papers we will examine a number of topics, including the possible Late Heavy Bombardment of the moon, tectonics on Venus,
water on Mars, hidden oceans on Europa, and the methane weather cycle on Titan.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on six 2500-word papers, discussion, and critical analysis. There will be a strong focus on polished writing and argu-
ment, and papers will be thoroughly edited by the professor for style, grammar and syntax. Students will improve their writing by integrating into successive
papers the editorial comments they receive, and also by editing the writing of their tutorial partners.
Prerequisites: one Geosciences course, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores.

GEOS 218T The Carbon Cycle and Climate (Same as Environmental Studies 218T) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
Carbon dioxide is the most important atmospheric greenhouse gas, and human activities are adding carbon to the atmosphere at unprecedented rates. Yet only half
of the carbon we emit each year remains in the atmosphere because biological, geological, and chemical processes continually cycle carbon from the atmosphere
to the ocean, to land plants and soils, and to sediments. The workings of the carbon cycle are at the center of many controversies surrounding the causes of past
climate changes and the outcome of future global warming. How was the earth's climate steered by past changes in the carbon cycle, billions and millions of years
ago? Will natural processes continue to take up such a high percentage of carbon emissions as emissions continue and climate changes? Can and should we coax
natural systems to take up even more carbon? How might carbon emissions be reduced on the scale of the Williams campus? We will explore these issues through
readings of current journal articles and reports.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: The class will meet weekly for a one-hour orientation to the topic, and students will meet in pairs for one hour each week with the
instructor. Each student will orally present a written paper every other week for criticism during the tutorial session. Evaluation will be based on the five papers
and each student's effectiveness as a critic.
Prerequisites: one introductory course in Biology, Chemistry, or Geosciences or one course cross-listed in the Environmental Studies program. Enrollment limit:
10 (expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores and juniors.

GEOS 253T(F) Coral Reefs (Same as Environmental Studies 253) (W)
Coral reefs worldwide face mounting ecological pressures from climate warming, coral diseases, dredging, pollution, overfishing, and increased destruction
caused by boat anchors, boat groundings, and mauling by recreational divers. Evaluating the present and long-term effects of these factors depends on an under-
standing of the complex dynamics of reef systems. This tutorial will investigate the geology, sedimentology, biogeochemistry, and ecology of coral reefs, both
modern and ancient. The course will be linked to a 2010 winter study course during which we will map a modern fringing reef complex on St. John, U.S. Virgin
Islands. Participation in the winter study excursion is not required of tutorial enrollees, but the tutorial is a prerequisite for the winter study course.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on six 2500-word (about 5 pages) papers, discussion, and critical analysis. There will be a strong focus on polished
writing and argument, and papers will be thoroughly edited for style, grammar and syntax. Students will improve their writing by integrating into successive
papers the editorial comments they receive, and also by editing the writing of their tutorial partners.
Prerequisites: one Geosciences course or consent of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (Expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores.
Tutorial meetings to be arranged.

GEOS 301(F) Structural Geology (Q)
The structure of the Earth's crust is constantly changing and the rocks making up the crust must deform to accommodate these changes. Rock deformation occurs
over many scales ranging from individual mineral grains to mountain belts. This course deals with the geometric description of structures, stress and strain analy-
sis, deformation mechanisms in rocks, and the large scale forces responsible for crustal deformation. The laboratories cover geologic maps and cross sections,
folds and faults, stereonet analysis, field techniques, strain, and stress.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly laboratory exercises, problem sets, a
midterm exam, and a final exam. Many of the laboratories and problem sets use geometry, algebra, and several projection techniques to solve common problems
in structural geology.
Prerequisites: Geosciences 101, 102, 103, or 105 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MW Lab: 1-4 M KARABINOS
GEOS 302(S) Sedimentology (W)
The composition and architecture of sediments and sedimentary rocks preserve information about the rocks that were eroded to form them, the fluids and forces
that transported them, the mechanisms by which they were deposited, and the processes by which they were lithified. This course will provide an introduction to
the principles of sedimentology, including sedimentary petrology, fluid mechanics, bedform analysis, and facies architecture.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week; two half-day and one all-day field trip. Evaluation will be based on laboratory
work, writing assignments, an hour exam, and a final exam. Ten written critiques (each 350-400 words) of specific assigned papers from the sedimentological
literature are designed to teach clear written expression and careful analytical reading. Papers will be thoroughly edited for style, grammar and syntax. Students
will improve their writing by integrating editorial comments into successive papers. Each student will compile his/her papers as a growing body of work, and each
new paper will be read and edited in the context of the previous submissions.
Prerequisites: Geosciences 202 (may be taken concurrently with permission of instructor). Enrollment limit: 16 (expected:12).

GEOS 350T Tectonics, Erosion, and Climate (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
Traditional models of landscape development postulate rapid pulses of tectonic uplift followed by long periods of gradual erosion. In sharp contrast, recent studies
suggest that landscape is the product of complex interactions between tectonics, erosion, and climate. It is clear that tectonic uplift directly affects erosion rates and
may induce orographic climate changes, but can climatically enhanced erosion rates drive tectonic processes? Can very rapid uplift and erosion in one region,
such as the Himalayas, affect global climate by sequestering greenhouse gases during the weathering of sediments? Some researchers believe so. This course will
explore the feedback mechanisms that have been proposed to explain how tectonics, erosion, and climate
affect one another and produce the landscapes we observe today. Topics will include plate tectonics and crustal thickening, erosion and exhumation processes,
climate and erosion rates, isostasy, equilibrium landscapes, formation of orogenic plateaus, and formation of the Himalayas and development of the Asian mon-
soon.
Format: tutorial. After an initial group meeting, students will meet in pairs for one hour each week with the instructor. Each student will orally present a written
paper every other week for criticism during the tutorial session.
Evaluation will be based on five 5-page papers and each student's effectiveness as a critic.
Prerequisites: at least one of the following courses: Geosciences 201, 202, 301, 302, 303, or 401 or with permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (ex-
pected:10). Preference given to Geosciences majors.

GEOS 360T(S) Geology of the Appalachians (W)
The Appalachians are the eroded remnants of a mountain range that once rivaled the Alps and, perhaps, the Himalayas in elevation. They formed hundreds of
millions of years ago in three distinct collisions with other continents. The Appalachians record a rich geologic history of continental rifting, formation and closing
of ocean basins, continental collision, and mountain building. We will read papers that describe the history of the Appalachians beginning with the Late Precam-
brian opening of the Iapetus ocean, through the Paleozoic orogenies that formed the Appalachians, and ending with the formation of the Atlantic. The history of
the Appalachians remains controversial, in part, because of diverse perspectives that geologists bring to their work and interpretations, such as different special-
ties, guiding paradigms, and field areas. The readings are designed to illuminate the roots of the important controversies as well as the geologic history of this well
studied mountain belt.
Format: tutorial; after an initial group meeting, students will meet in pairs for one hour each week with the instructor. Each student will orally present a written
paper every other week for criticism during the tutorial session. Evaluation will be based on the five papers and each student's effectiveness as a critic.
Prerequisites: one upper-level Geosciences course. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

GEOS 401 Stratigraphy (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Study of the composition, sequence, and correlation of layered sedimentary rocks is traditionally applied to geologic mapping and the reconstruction of ancient
environments. Through the use of various time scales, stratigraphy is the unifier of historical geology while also at the heart of conceptual debates over the
uniformism or episodicity of geological processes. During the first half of the course, emphasis will be placed on the various methods of correlation based on
physical means and the use of fossils. The second half of the course will focus on plate migrations and the relationships between climate and depositional environ-
ments as a model for the broad scale interpretation of sedimentary sequences. This part of the course will be conducted as a seminar, with students responsible for
topics on the paleogeographic linkage of climate-sensitive facies and natural resources. As a final project, students working individually or in pairs will present a
detailed analysis of North-American stratigraphic relationships during a specific interval of Cambrian to Cretaceous time. In sequence, these class reports will
provide highlights of the geologic history of the North-American continent through Paleozoic and Mesozoic time.
Format: lecture, three hours a week; one three-hour lab per week during the first half of the course (including field problems); independent projects during the
second half of the course; one major field trip. Evaluation will be based on weekly lab assignments during the first half of the semester, seminar participation, and
the completion of a final project during the second half of the semester, as well as a midterm and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Geosciences 302 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 12).

GEOS 403(F) Geologic Controls of Earth's Climate
The effects of plate tectonics, uplift and erosion of mountain ranges, and volcanism extend beyond the solid Earth. These processes are fundamentally linked to
ocean circulation, chemical weathering, the hydrological cycle and the carbon cycle and exert a major influence on the Earth's climate state. We will explore how
climate was affected by the closing of the Panama and Indonesian Seaways, the uplift of the Himalayas, and the opening of the Drake Passage. We will also
examine the evolution of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the South Asian Monsoon and the onset of Antarctic and Northern Hemisphere glaciation. Each
week, there will be a lecture introducing a topic followed by student-led discussions of articles from the scientific literature.
Format: lecture and seminar discussion, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on short, weekly papers, class discussions, and execution and oral presen-
tation of an independent project.
Prerequisites: at least one 300-level Geosciences class or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 7). Preference given to Geosciences majors.

LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. German
101-W-102 stresses communicative competence and covers German grammar in full. German 103 combines a review of grammar with extensive practice in
reading and conversation. German 104 aims to develop facility in speaking, writing, and reading. German 111-112 offers an alternative introduction to German
with a focus on reading competence. German 201 emphasizes accuracy and idiomatic expression in speaking and writing. German 202 combines advanced
language study with the examination of topics in German-speaking cultures. Students who have studied German in secondary school should take the placement
test given during First Days in September to determine which course to take.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students who wish to attain fluency in German to spend a semester or year studying in Germany or Austria, either inde-
pendently or in one of several approved foreign study programs. German 104 or the equivalent is the minimum requirement for junior-year abroad programs
sponsored by American institutions. Students who wish to enroll directly in a German-speaking university should complete at least 201 or the equivalent. In any
case, all students considering study-abroad should discuss their language preparation with a member of the department.
LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on German literature in translation for students who have little or no knowledge of German, but who wish to become
acquainted with the major achievements in German literary and intellectual history.
ADVANCED STUDIES
The department offers a variety of advanced courses for students who wish to investigate German literature, thought, and culture in the original. German 202 is
given each year and is recommended as preparation for upper-level courses.
THE CERTIFICATE IN GERMAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the department offers the Certificate in German. It requires seven courses--three fewer than the
major--and is especially appropriate for students who begin study of the language at Williams.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in German may substitute more advanced courses for the 100-level courses; they can also be exempted
from up to two of the required courses.
The student must achieve proficiency at the level of a B in German 104 or the equivalent.
Appropriate elective courses can usually be found among the offerings of German, Art History, History, Music, Philosophy, Political Science, and Theatre.

THE MAJOR
The German major offers students an interdisciplinary approach to German intellectual and cultural history by combining courses in German language and
literature with courses in History, Philosophy, Music, and other appropriate fields.
For students who start German at Williams, the major requires a minimum of ten courses: German 101-102, 103, 104, 201 and 202; two 300-level German
courses; and two electives from either German courses numbered above 202 or appropriate offerings in other departments.
For students who have acquired intermediate or greater proficiency in the language before coming to Williams, the minimum requirement is nine courses:
German 202; two 300-level German courses; and six other courses selected from German courses numbered above 102 and appropriate offerings in other depart-
ments.
Examples of appropriate courses in other departments are:
ArtH 267 Art in Germany: 1960 to the Present
History 239 Modern German History
History 338 The History of the Holocaust
Music 108 The Symphony
Music 117 Mozart
Music 118 Bach
Music 120 Beethoven

GERM 202(S) Vienna 1900-2000 and Beyond
Once the center of a vast empire, Austria has tended to be overlooked since the demise of that empire. In fact, though, its trajectory can usefully serve as a guide to
the complex developments in Europe before, during, and after the Second World War. Contemporary Austria is indeed a laboratory of post-Cold War Europe: Its
population is remarkably multicultural, in spite of resistances; its language is rich and dynamic, yet increasingly dominated by its more powerful neighbor to the
north; its political attitudes encompass extreme nationalism, pan-Europeanism, and much in between. Austria's capital, Vienna, will form the lens through which
we examine the origins and quirks of this fascinating, sometimes paradoxical, culture. The course will employ a variety of written, video, audio, and cyber-materi-
als to explore some of the issues facing contemporary Austria, and to continue the development of advanced reading, writing, and speaking skills begun in
German 201. Conducted in German.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: active class participation, several 1- to 2-page writing assignments, final written/oral project.
Prerequisite: German 201 or the equivalent. Enrollment Limit: 16 (expected: 8). Preference given to German majors.

GERM 202 Berlin--Multicultural Metropolis Between East and West (Not offered 2009-2010)
We will examine texts and films about Berlin as a center of cultural and social transformations in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with special emphasis
on the post-wall period. We will move from the turn of the century (when the city's population had recently tripled in size) to the establishing of Berlin as a world

GENERAL STATEMENT OF GOALS
The History department seeks to cultivate a critical understanding and awareness of the past and the development of our students' intellectual, analytical, and
rhetorical abilities. In pursuit of the first objective, through its curricular offerings the department seeks both to expose students to the richness, diversity, and
complexities of human history over long periods of time and in different geographic regions and to provide students with the opportunity to explore aspects of the
past in depth. At the same time, the department endeavors to develop students' ability to think historically and to foster in them an appreciation of the contested
nature and the value of historical knowledge by confronting them with the variety of ways in which historians have approached and interpreted the past, engaging
them in issues that provoke historical debate, and familiarizing them with the nature and uses of historical evidence. By engaging students in the critical study of
the past, finally, the department seeks to develop their ability to formulate historically informed analyses and their analytical and rhetorical skills.
COURSE NUMBERS
The course numbering system used by the History Department reflects the different types and objectives of courses offered at each level. The different course
levels are distinguished less by degree of difficulty than by the purposes that the courses at each level are intended to serve and the background knowledge they
presume.
First-Year Seminars and Tutorials (102-199): These writing-intensive courses give students an opportunity to explore an exciting historical topic in-
depth, learn about the discipline of history, and improve their research and writing skills. Because these courses emphasize the acquisition of skills
required for the advanced study of History, they are ideal for students contemplating a major in History.
Each 100-level seminar is normally limited to nineteen students and focuses both on training in research skills (such as using the library, navigating
on-line resources, formulating a research question and developing a research agenda, and learning how to use different types of evidence) and on the
acquisition of reading skills (such as how to interpret different kinds of historical writing and the arguments historians make). These seminars especially
emphasize the importance of writing and include varied assignments that stress the mechanics of writing and revision and focus on issues of argu-
mentation, documentation, and style. Enrollment preference in 100-level seminars is normally given to first-year students and then to sophomores.
Each 100-level tutorial stresses the importance of interpreting historical evidence and evaluating the arguments made by historians and likewise fulfills
the writing-intensive requirement. Enrollment in these courses is limited to ten students, each of whom is expected to write five or six interpretive
essays and present five or six oral critiques of another student's work. First-year students and sophomores will normally be given equal enrollment
preference in 100-level tutorials, although first-year students will not normally be permitted to enroll in a tutorial during the first semester.
Because first-year seminars and tutorials serve as an introduction to the study of history, only one course of each type may count toward the History
major; these courses can also be used to meet the department's group and concentration requirements.
Introductory Survey Courses (202-299): These courses are open to all students and are intended to provide a basic understanding of the history of
peoples, countries, and geographic regions over relatively long time-spans. Most of all, they will provide students with the background necessary for
more advanced study in history at the 300 and 400 level. They are offered in either small or large formats, depending on the individual course.
Major Seminars (301): Major seminars explore the nature and practice of history, are required for the degree in History, and are normally restricted to
junior History majors. Although these seminars vary in topic and approach, each focuses on the discipline of history itself--on the debates over how to
approach the past, on questions of the status of different kinds of evidence and how to use it, on the purpose of the study of history. Focusing on
questions of methodology, epistemology, and historiography, these courses ask: What kind of knowledge do historians claim to produce? What does it
mean to study the past? How do historians approach the project of studying the past? Each year several major seminars will be offered. Students who
plan to study abroad during their junior year may take their Major Seminar in the spring semester of their sophomore year, and those planning to be
away for the whole of their junior year are strongly encouraged to do so.
Advanced Electives (302-396): These advanced, topical courses are more specialized in focus than are the introductory survey courses (202-299) and
are intended to follow such courses. Enrollment is often limited. Because these courses may presume some background knowledge, the instructor may
recommend that students enroll in an appropriate introductory course before registering for an advanced elective.
Advanced Seminars (402-479): These are advanced courses normally limited in enrollment to fifteen students. Each seminar will investigate a topic in
depth and will require students to engage in research that leads to a substantial piece of historical writing. All History majors are required to complete
either an advanced seminar (402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the area of the seminar. Preference is
given to senior History majors, followed by junior History majors.
Advanced Tutorials (480-492): These are advanced reading and writing courses that offer an in-depth analysis of a topic in tutorial format. Tutorials are limited
in enrollment to ten students and preference is given to senior History majors. All History majors are required to complete either an advanced seminar
(402-479) or a tutorial (480-492). Instructors may recommend prior coursework in the area of the tutorial. The writing of five or six essays and the oral presen-
tation of five or six critiques of another student's essays are central to tutorials.
Within each of these levels, courses are further divided by geographical area:
Africa and the Middle East 102-111 202-211 302-311 402-411
Asia 112-121 212-221 312-321 412-421
Europe and Russia 122-141 222-241 322-341 422-441
Latin America and the Caribbean 142-151 242-251 342-351 442-451
United States 152-191 252-291 352-387 452-471
Transnational/Comparative 192-199 292-299 388-396 472-479
ADVISING
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to talk at any time with the department chair, the department administrative assistant, or any other member of the
department about the History major.
All incoming majors will choose a faculty advisor in the spring of their sophomore year. All majors must meet with their advisor in the beginning of the fall
semester, to develop their Concentration (see below), and at the time of the spring semester registration period in order to have their courses and plans for the
History major approved. Students who are interested in the senior honors program or graduate school should contact the faculty director of the Honors Program.
Prospective study abroad students should contact the department's administrative assistant.
THE MAJOR
The major consists of at least nine semester courses as follows:
Required Courses in the Major
One Major Seminar (History 301)
At least one Advanced Seminar (History 402-479) or Tutorial (History 480-492)
Elective Courses
Seven (or more) additional semester courses in History, at least one to be chosen from among three of the following groups:
Group A: The History of Africa
Group B: The History of Asia
Group C: The History of Europe and Russia
152
Group D: The History of Latin America and the Caribbean
Group E: The History of the Middle East
Group F: The History of the United States and Canada
In addition, students must take at least one course dealing with the premodern period (designated Group G in the catalog); this may be one of the courses used
to fulfill the group requirement (Groups A-F).
A single course can meet the requirement for no more than one of Groups A through F.
Concentration in the Major
All students are required to adopt a concentration within the History major. Students are responsible for designing their own concentration, in consultation with
a faculty advisor, in the fall semester of their Junior year. Each student's concentration will be formally approved by the Department's Curriculum Committee. A
concentration will consist of at least three courses linked by common themes, geography, or time period; only one of those courses can be a 100-level seminar
while at least one must be a 300- or 400-level course. Courses in the concentration may be used to fulfill the group requirements. In the Concentration Proposal,
the student must list a minimum total of six courses that could satisfy the requirements of the concentration, from which they can select three to fulfill the con-
centration requirement (recognizing that not all courses are offered every year); courses taken abroad may be included in the concentration with the approval of
the chair.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN HISTORY
The History Department offers a thesis route to the degree with honors in History. This involves a ten-course major as well as an independent WSP. Students
wishing to undertake independent research or considering graduate study are encouraged to participate in the thesis program and honors seminar.
Application to enter the honors program should be made by spring registration in the junior year and should be based on a solid record of work of honors
caliber, normally defined as maintaining at least a B+ average in courses taken for the major. Students who intend to write an honors thesis must submit a proposal
to the History Department at this time. Students who will be away during the spring semester of their junior year should make arrangements to apply before
leaving. Normally, it is the responsibility of the individual student to procure the agreement of a member of the department to act as his or her thesis advisor, and
the student must therefore consult with a member of the department about a thesis topic and a possible thesis advisor prior to submitting a proposal to the depart-
ment. A student who is uncertain of which member of the department might be an appropriate advisor, or who otherwise is unable to find an advisor, should
contact the chair of the honors committee. An honors thesis proposal must be signed by a member of the History Department. Normally, the thesis topic should be
related to course work which the student has previously done. Students should be aware, however, that while the department will try to accommodate all students
who qualify to pursue honors, particular topics may be deemed unfeasible and students may have to revise their topics accordingly. Final admission to the honors
program will depend on the department's assessment of the qualifications of the student and the feasibility of the project.
Once the student has been notified of admission to the honors program, he or she should register for History 493, Senior Honors Thesis Research Seminar, in
the fall semester, for History 031 during winter study, and for History 494, Senior Honors Thesis Writing Seminar, in the spring. In addition to doing the research
for and writing a thesis of approximately 75-100 pages, students will attend special presentations under the History Department's Class of 1960 Scholars Pro-
gram.
During the fall, students should work regularly on their research and consult frequently with their advisors. Throughout the semester, honors candidates will
also present written progress reports for group discussion to the seminar (History 493). Performance in the seminar will be evaluated on the basis of class partici-
pation and completed written work and will determine if a student will continue in the thesis program. For students proceeding to History 031 and History 494,
performance in the fall semester will figure into the thesis grade calculated at the end of the year.
Students who are deemed to be making satisfactory progress on their research and writing at this point will be allowed to continue with the thesis. They will
devote the entire winter study period to thesis work. They should conclude their research during winter study and complete at least one chapter of their thesis for
submission to their advisor before the end of winter study. At the end of winter study, the honors committee will formally consult with advisors and make recom-
mendations to the department concerning which students should be allowed to proceed with the thesis. During the early weeks of the second semester, students
will present a draft chapter of their thesis to the honors seminar.
Completed theses will be due in mid-April, after which each student will prepare and make a short oral presentation of his or her thesis for delivery at the
departmental Honors Colloquium. Another student who has read the thesis will then offer a critique of it, after which the two faculty readers of the thesis will offer
their own comments and questions. Finally, there will be a general discussion of the thesis by students and other members of the department.
LANGUAGE
Study of a foreign language is basic to the understanding of other cultures. Particularly those students who might wish to do graduate work in History are
encouraged to enroll in language courses at Williams.
STUDY ABROAD
The History Department considers immersion in and familiarity with a foreign culture not only to be valuable in themselves, but also to provide an important
way of understanding the past. Students who major in History therefore are encouraged to study a foreign language and to consider studying abroad during their
junior year. History courses taken as part of a study abroad program that is recognized by the college normally can be used to satisfy departmental distribution and
general requirements, up to a maximum of three courses (this limit does not apply to tutorials taken as part of the Williams-Exeter Program; no courses taken
abroad, even at Oxford, can be used to satisfy the major seminar and advanced seminar/tutorial requirements). Students who plan to study abroad during their
junior year may take their Major Seminar in the spring semester of their sophomore year, and those planning to be away the whole of their junior year are strongly
encouraged to do so.
Students interested in studying abroad during their junior year should discuss their plans with a member of the department as well as with the department's
administrative assistant. Approval of departmental credit for courses taken abroad normally must be obtained from the chair or from the administrative assistant
prior to the commencement of the study abroad program.

FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS: Africa and the Middle East (102-111)
HIST 103 The City in Africa: Nairobi and Johannesburg (Same as Africana Studies 103) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
(W)
Accra, Nairobi, and Johannesburg are three major African cities with very different origins. In each of these cities African, Asian, Arabic, and European cultures
have converged and intermingled in complicated ways that give rise to hybrid cultures, economies, and politics. This seminar will trace the development of these
cities from the 19th century to the present. The experience of various groups of city dwellers will be our main focus, as well as the development of the cities'
physical infrastructure like transportation, housing, trade, and labor networks. More importantly, though, we will explore the underworld of these cities and will,
with the inquisitiveness of a voyeur, the zeal of a private investigator, and the sensibility of a historian, examine ways in which class, race ethnicity, nationality,
politics, and gender have influenced the structural growth of these cities and the experiences of their inhabitants. Students will also get a chance to read about the
various artistic movements in these cities over the last century, focusing especially on music, theater, and street performances. Students should emerge from this
course with a greater awareness of African urban life and with a deepened understanding of colonial and postcolonial societies in Africa and elsewhere in the
so-called Third World.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, five short papers, and a final research paper.

HIST 104(S) Travel Narratives and African History (Same as Africana Studies 104) (W)
In a way, all historical thinking and writing deals with travel accounts given that, as many scholars have noted, the past can be likened to a foreign country and the
historian can be viewed as a traveler in foreign places. Nevertheless, actual travel narratives--narratives about the actual physical visits of writers to distant
landscall for careful and critical analysis because they can be seductive, and they can shape the ways we think about the presentand the pastof distant lands and
cultures. This course discusses Arab, European, African and African American travel narratives about various regions of Africa since the 14th century. We will
mine the travel accounts for descriptions of local contexts. We will also explore what travel writing says about the author's perceptions of self, home, and "other."
Ultimately, we will investigate the authors' biases and how the narratives influence both our perception of Africa and the writing of African history. This course is
highly interdisciplinary and draws heavily on literary, anthropological, geographical, and historical methodologies.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, oral reports, 1-2 short papers and a research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference will be given to first-year students, and then to sophomores who have not previously taken a

Utilizing biographical studies and the general literature on the political and cultural history of the period, this course will analyze how these individuals achieved
prominence in Middle Eastern society and how they addressed the pertinent problems of their day, such as war and peace, relations with Western powers, the role
of religion in society, and the status of women. A range of significant individuals will be studied, including Gamal Abd al-Nasser, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,
Ayatollah Khomeini, Muhammad Mussadiq, Umm Khulthum, Sayyid Qutb, Anwar Sadat, Naghuib Mahfouz, and Huda Shaarawi.

HIST 117T Clash of Empires: China and the West, 1800-1900 (Same as Asian Studies 117T) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered
2010-2011) (W)
As ever greater numbers of Western traders sought access to China's products and markets in the early nineteenth century, their ideas of free trade, hopes for
commercial expansion, and expectations for international intercourse clashed with the policies and practices of the Qing Dynasty's multi-ethnic empire. This
conflict reached a climax in the mid-century Opium Wars, in which China's defeat inaugurated a period of Western domination by several powers (including
Britain, France, the United States, and later, Japan). Despite its weakened position, the Qing dynasty continued to contest the definition and scope of Western
privilege in China through the end of the century. Historians have long disagreed over how to interpret this "clash of empires," some seeing Western involvement
in China as exploitative imperialism and others seeing it as a positive, modernizing force. In either case, however, this conflict profoundly affected China's nation-
al development in the twentieth century, and continues to inform contemporary China's view of itself and its international position.
This tutorial course will examine a series of significant points of contention between the Qing Dynasty and expanding Western powers during this period. These
will include the opium trade, Christian missionaries, extraterritorial privilege, Western technology, the looting of Chinese artworks and antiquities, and contests
over sovereignty in Tibet and Manchuria. We will examine both Western and Chinese perspectives on these conflicts, how the period has been remembered and
interpreted, and how it continues to affect Chinese and Western perceptions of China's place in the world.
Format: tutorial. Students in the tutorial will meet in weekly one-hour sessions with the instructor and a classmate. Each week, students will alternate between
writing a 5- to 7-page paper on the assigned readings (to be presented orally in class) and writing and presenting a 2-page critique of his/her classmate's paper. The
course will conclude with a final paper that examines one of the issues raised in class in greater depth.

HIST 119 The Japanese Empire (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
The largest non-Western empire of modern times, Japan extended its reach to Taiwan, Korea, China, Sakhalin, Southeast Asia, and the South Pacific. This course
explores the many contentious political, economic, social, and cultural questions that arise from Japan's imperial project. We will ask what drove imperialist
expansion; how the Japanese ruled; who won and lost in economic relations; what various aspects of life were like in the empire; how to understand the dynamics
between Japanese settlers and the colonized; what effects empire building had at home in Japan; how to explain the nature of wartime conquests; and what
legacies Japanese imperialism and empire left in their wake. Throughout the semester, we will make a point of examining these issues from various standpoints,
and we will also read theoretical works that place the Japanese empire in a comparative context. Course materials will include political documents, intellectual
treatises, films, memoirs, and literature.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, response papers, short essays, and a final research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference will be given to first-year students, and then to sophomores who have not previously taken a

FIRST-YEAR SEMINARS AND TUTORIALS: EUROPE AND RUSSIA (122-141)
HIST 124 The Vikings (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
Viking raiders in longships burst through the defenses of ninth-century Europe, striking terror in the hearts of peasants, monks, and kings for the next three
centuries. Yet the impact of these sea-born Scandinavians on European civilization was more complex and constructive than portrayed by medieval chroniclers.
Vikings acted as merchants, craftsmen, farmers, settlers, and mercenaries, and they colonized regions beyond the edges of the known world like Russia, Iceland,
and North America. This course explores the complicated relationship of the Vikings with the medieval world and examines important developments within
Scandinavian society such as kingship, trade, and Christianization. At the same time, we will consider the methodological difficulties presented by the diverse and
often contradictory historical sources for the Vikings such as monastic chronicles, archaeology, inscriptions, and Scandinavian sagas.
Format: seminar/lecture. Evaluation will be based on class participation and several papers and assignments.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference will be given to first-year students, and then sophomores who have not previously taken a

HIST 127 The Expansion of Europe (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
This course investigates the expansion of European power and influence over much of the rest of the world from the late Middle Ages to the mid-nineteenth
century--the early period of European Imperialism. Specific topics will vary, but include the development and initial expansion of medieval and Renaissance
Europe, the discovery and conquest of the New World, the struggle with Islam for command of the seas, the establishment of European influence in the East and
Far East, the slave trade, the invasion of North America, and the initial steps toward hegemony in the Middle East and Africa. Students will investigate the ways in
which individual personality, religiosity, greed, critical first contacts, and cultural misunderstandings and prejudices combined with important aspects of the Mili-
tary, Scientific, and early Industrial Revolutions to establish European hegemony on a world-wide scale during this early period of European Imperialism.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on five short written exercises and one research paper.

HIST 128T(S) Conquistadors in the New World (W)
The Spanish conquest of the Americas happened with astonishing rapidity. Christopher Columbus entered the Caribbean in 1492; Hernando Cortes completed
the conquest of the Aztecs of central Mexico in 1521; Francisco Pizarro triumphantly entered the Inca capital Cuzco, in Peru, in 1545. Other conquistadors
154
pushed north to the Carolinas and California, south to the Tierra del Fuego and the River Plate, and across the Amazonian basin to the Atlantic. "We came," wrote
the conquistador Bernal Diaz del Castillo, "to serve God, and our King, and to get rich." Their deeds were legendary, their courage, daring, and endurance remark-
able. They were also notoriously quarrelsome, greedy, and cruel. Before their onslaught the major civilizations of the new world crumbled--destroyed or
changed beyond recognition. Rarely in history have so few conquered so many so quickly. The conquest of the New World has both excited and appalled the
human imagination for more than five centuries. Many questions about the event remain to be answered or are still capable of provoking controversy, questions
that will be addressed in this tutorial: Who exactly were the conquistadors? What motivated them? How did their self-perpetuating conquistador system originate
and operate? What meaning did they themselves assign to their actions? How could they justify their many, misdeeds? How did they develop their sense of the
Other? Why did often inspired resistance by indigenous peoples and regimes ultimately fail? Was conquest somehow preordained? Could it have failed? What
mixture of human agency, culture, technology, religion, nature, and biology can best explain the results of this encounter between the conquistador and Amerin-
dian worlds?
Format: tutorial. Students will meet in weekly one-hour sessions with a student tutorial partner and the instructor, one presenting a paper, the other offering a
critique.

HIST 129 Blacks, Jews, and Women in the Age of the French Revolution (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
The French Revolution was an important turning point in world history. Besides ushering in an age of libert (liberty) and egalit (equality), it also postulated the
existence of a new revolutionary fraternit (brotherhood) between peoples of all backgrounds. Would revolutionary fraternity include women, African slaves, and
Jews in the new democratic polity? French men and women debated these questions in ways that have had a direct impact on our contemporary discussions of
race, gender, religious freedom and ethnicity. In this course, we will explore these debates, their Enlightenment roots, and the legacy of these debates for France's
minorities today, especially those of Arabic and Islamic origin. Students will be introduced to various types of historical sources (rare books, art, opera, plays), as
well as to the lively historiographical debates between historians of France concerning methodology, politics, and the goal of historical research.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, oral reports, 1-2 short papers, a 15- to 20-page research paper, and a final examination (may be
an oral and/or take-home exam). The class will also be expected to go on a couple of field trips.

HIST 135T The Great War, 1914-1918 (Same as Leadership Studies 135T) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
During the nineteenth and early twentieth century Europeans and their immediate offspring created the modern world. European industry, science, trade, weap-
ons, and culture dominated the globe. After a century of general peace the continual "progress" of Western Civilization seemed assured. Then, in August, 1914,
the major European powers went to war with one another. After four years of unprecedented carnage, violence, and destruction, Europe was left exhausted and
bitter, its previous optimism replaced by pessimism, its world position undermined, and its future clouded by a deeply flawed peace settlement.
What were the fundamental causes of the Great War? How and why did it break out when it did and who was responsible? Why was it so long, ferocious,
wasteful, and, until the very end, indecisive? Why did the Allies, rather than the Central Powers, emerge victorious? What did the peace settlement settle? How
was Europe changed? What is the historical significance of the conflict?

HIST 136 Before the Deluge: Paris and Berlin in the Interwar Years (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
Paris and Berlin were the two poles of Europe in the 1920s, rival capital cities of two historically hostile nations that had only just put an end to the carnage of
World War I. Paris was the grande dame; Berlin the upstart. In the 1920s, these two pulsating metropolises became the sites of political and cultural movements
that would leave a lasting imprint on European society until the present day. This course focuses on the politics, society, and culture of these two cities in their
heyday in the 1920s. We will also consider their fate in the 1930s, first as depression set in, and then as the Nazis came to power. Devoting half the semester to
Paris and the other half to Berlin, we will examine a range of parallel topics in both contexts, including the impact of World War I, the growing popularity of
right-wing political movements and the increase in political violence, shifting gender norms and sexual mores, and new developments in the realms of art, film,
theatre, cabaret, and literature.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, several short papers, and a final research paper.

HIST 141 Modernism, Leisure, and Subjectivity in Fin-de-Sicle Russia (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
This course introduces students to the artistic movements, everyday life, and socio-cultural upheavals of urban Russia in the fin-de-sicle (1881 to 1914). The
fast-paced, consumer-oriented modern city, with its celebrities, fashions, and technological wonders, gripped the imagination of imperial Russia's urban denizens.
The inhabitants of St. Petersburg and Moscow, conscious of living in a new era, embraced and grappled with the Modern Age as journalists, impresarios, and
artists narrated and interpreted it. We will explore the ways revolution and war, industrialization, the commercialization of culture, and new sensibilities about the
self and identity were reflected in modernist art and thought, literature, and autobiographical writings. We also will look closely at the realms of elite entertainment
and popular amusement in an attempt to relate consumer culture to notions of gender and sexuality, the redefinition of status and privilege, and concepts of leisure.
Historians have offered competing explanations of how and why the rapid social, economic and cultural changes of this period contributed to the fall of the
Russian monarchy and the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Our primary goal will be to use sources to assess their arguments and, hopefully, make our own. Texts
include: historical scholarship, literary works, philosophical and sociological writings, music, visual art, and film.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short essays, and a final research paper.

HIST 147 Women and Men in Twentieth-Century Latin America (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 147) (Not offered 2009-2010; to
be offered 2010-2011) (W)
The twentieth century saw massive transformations in virtually all realms of Latin American societies. Notions about the roles of men and women, however,
displayed less obvious changes: machismo, stereotypes would have us believe, remains very much in force. Using a variety of texts--including literary fiction,
videos, photography, and anthropological and historical studies--we will evaluate the consequences of such dominant visions--as well as the inadequacies of
analyses based on them. Besides looking at machismo and its corollaries, we will explore how such codes have faced alternative readings by women and men and
the challenges of subversive gender identities and sexualities. Topics will include the modernization of patriarchal relations, domestic violence and men's real and
attempted control over "their" women, the repercussions of women's changing participation in the industrializing and globalized economies of the late-twentieth
century, the problematic relationship between women's movements and progressive and revolutionary politics, and the links between racial/ethnic identities and
gender roles.

HIST 148(S) The Mexican Revolution: 1910 to NAFTA (W)
The first great revolution in the twentieth century, the Mexican Revolution was as dramatic and compelling as later episodes in Russia, China and Cuba. Using a
wide variety of sources--from films, murals, and comic books to classic works of political and social history--this seminar will examine the forces that exploded
155
in over a decade of violence and produced the peculiar "institutional revolutionary" government that ruled Mexico from the 1920s to the crises of the late 1990s.
Was the Revolution a true social revolution or just a "palace coup"? Did workers, women, peasants, or indigenous peoples make real gains in social or political
power during the after the Revolution? How democratic or authoritarian is the Mexico that emerged from the brutal decade of the 1910s? Finally, in light of
globalization, the political scandals of the 1990s, and ongoing peasant rebellion in Chiapas, is the Revolution dead or is its promise only now to be fulfilled?

HIST 149(F) The 1959 Cuban Revolution: Precedents, Processes, and Legacies, 1898-2009 (Same as Africana Studies 149) (W)
Few events shaped world politics during the second half of the twentieth century as profoundly as the Cuban Revolution of 1959. Transformed by the leadership
of Fidel Castro into a socialist country battling U.S. intervention, Cuba embodied the anti-imperialist aspirations of generations of Latin Americans whose econo-
mies and political destinies remained firmly bound to the policy goals of the United States. Cubans who lived the Revolution, however, differed in their reactions
to it: while many celebrated the social impact of Cuba's revolution, many others condemned the revolutionary state as nothing more than a repressive (albeit
populist) dictatorship. Exploring the precedents, processes, and legacies of the Cuban Revolution during the year of its fiftieth anniversary (2009), this course will
give students a better understanding of how and why the Cuban state has endured for so long in the face of U.S. hostility. We will read historical monographs,
speeches by revolutionary leaders, and testimonies of Cubans living during the 20th century to access these themes. And while the course will begin in 1898 with
the Cuban wars for independence, it will end in the present and explore the meaning of President Obama's closure of U.S. prison camps in Guantanamo and the
transition from Fidel to Raul (and beyond) to try and answer the question that is on the minds of most Cubans and scholars of Cuban history: What next?
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation, five short papers, and a final research project.

HIST 152(F) The Fourteenth Amendment and the Meanings of Equality (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 152) (W)
For more than a century, the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution has served as the principal touchstone for legal debates over the meaning of equality and
freedom in the United States. This course explores the origins of the 14th Amendment in the years immediately following the Civil War, and examines the
evolution of that amendment's meaning in the century that followed. Central themes in this course include the contested interpretations of "due process," "privi-
leges and immunities," "equal protection," and "life, liberty or property"; the rise, fall, and rebirth of substantive due process; and the battles over incorporating
the Bill of Rights into the 14th Amendment. We will pay particular attention to how debates over the 14th Amendment have shaped and been shaped by the
changing meanings of racial and gender equality, and how the 14th Amendment has transformed the promise and experience of American citizenship.

HIST 154T The American Way of War: The First Three Centuries (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
Is there an historically distinct American way of war? How have Americans experienced warfare? From the earliest days of European settlement through the final
campaigns against American Indians west of the Mississippi, Americans have often been at war. Long before the United States became a world power those
conflicts had determined many of the basic contours of American society, culture, and nationhood. This tutorial will investigate the nature and development of
American wars over the period 1600 to 1900. Though some attention will be paid to the American Revolution and the Civil War, the tutorial will concentrate
primarily on lesser known but still historically significant wars, including King Philip's War, the Seven Years War, the War of 1812, Jackson's Indian Wars, the
Mexican-American War, the Plains Indians Wars, and the Spanish American War. All but the last were fought to conclusion in North America itself. How did
Americans fight these wars? How did American militaries establish control over such a huge and varied continent? What role did military institutions play in the
development of a distinctive American society? Did war abet social mobility, or lend itself to social control? What role did race play in the creation and sustaining
of martial goals? What was the relationship between local military institutions and centralist attempts to create a national and/or professional army? What was the
impact of warfare on American culture, on concepts of masculinity, and national or community images? Despite the fact that Americans have often conceived of
themselves as a peace-loving people, war from the beginning has played a key role in shaping their society and nation. It is exactly the nature, meaning, and
paradoxes of American wars that this tutorial will attempt to unravel.
Format: tutorial. Students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Each student will write and present orally a 7-page essay every other week
on the readings assigned for that week. In alternate weeks, students will be responsible for offering an oral critique of the work of their partner.

HIST 158(F) Thicker than Water: American Political Dynasties (W)
In a nation long committed to democratic principles, dynasties of any sort are bound to seem anomalous. Yet in six different instances members of the same family
have held or aspired to hold the highest office in the land, the Presidency of the United States. Our purpose will be to analyze three of those families: the Adamses,
the Roosevelts, and the Kennedys. In particular, we will focus on the paths they took to power, their performance as political leaders, and the legacies they left
behind. Throughout the semester we will also be exploring what differences family ties--the dynastic element--made in the three histories in question.
Format: seminar. Readings will consist of primary as well as secondary sources, with frequent short papers developing major points in the reading, and a longer

HIST 162 "New Worlds for All": European-Indian Encounters in Colonial North America (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
This course focuses on the interactions between Indians and Europeans in the contexts of Spanish, French, Dutch, and British exploration and colonization of
North America. Drawing upon our critical reading of secondary and primary sources, we will explore the political, economic, social, and cultural transformations
visited upon both Indian and Euro-American societies as a result of European attempts to control vast North American territories from the Saint Lawrence valley
to Florida and from the Lower Mississippi valley to California. Because of the large scope of our inquiry we will proceed both chronologically and thematically.
Our themes will include: Indian resistance and adaptation to European invasions and evangelizing efforts; diplomacy, warfare, and the evolution of North Ameri-
can geopolitics; Frontier exchange economies and the transformation of material cultures; the transformation and construction of colonial identities (Euro-Ameri-
can and Indian concepts of "self," the racialization of Euro-American perceptions of Indians and Indians' perceptions of Europeans). Over the course of the
semester, students will write several response papers based on secondary readings to help them assess how historians have addressed these themes. These papers
will serve as the basis for our discussion of the methodologies, theories, and sources historians use to reconstruct the history of European-Indian encounters. Short
response papers will also familiarize students with some of the most important historiographical debates of colonial North American history and will help them
conceptualize and write an original research paper based upon a combination of primary and secondary sources.

HIST 164(S) Slavery in the United States (Same as Africana Studies 164) (W)
Slavery and freedom rose as concomitant ideologies--simultaneously and interrelated--critical to the development of the American colonies and United States.
Few areas of American social, political, and economic history have been more active and exciting in recent years than the study of this relationship. This seminar
introduces students to the most important aspects of American slavery, beginning with an examination of the international slave trade and traces the development
of the "peculiar institution" to its demise with the Civil War.
Format: seminar. In addition to reading key books in the field, students will engage in primary source research using the College library's extensive holdings of
microfilm and local records dealing with slavery in the North and the South. Building on several preliminary essays, each student will complete a research project

Ever since the Manhattan Project produced atomic weapons for Harry Truman to use against Japan at the end of World War II, atomic science has fueled Ameri-
cans' fears, hopes, nightmares, and fantasies. This course will examine all aspects of American nuclear culture, from scientists' movements to abolish atomic
weapons and expand peaceful atomic energy production to dystopian fiction about the nuclear apocalypse. It will investigate the role of the nuclear arms race in
the cold war and the development of civil defense and bomb shelter culture in the United States. Using scholarly books and articles, primary sources, novels, and

The beginning of the twentieth century saw the rise of two influential African American thinkers, W. E. B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington. The intellectual
and social programs that the two offered as solutions to the "race problem" are often seen as diametrically opposed to one another. This course will begin with an
examination of the writings and intellectual production of these two men. Did they share a common ground? What were their responses and solutions to "the
Negro question"? How did their ideas take effect? We will also set their work into an African American historical context, examining concurrent social develop-
ments such as the mass migration of African Americans to northern cities, the workings of the sharecropping system, and the cultural production of African
American film and music artists in the first decades of the twentieth century. Readings will include works by Washington and DuBois, autobiographies of lesser-

HIST 193(F) Black Power Abroad: Decolonization in Africa, the Caribbean and Europe (Same as Africana Studies 193) (D) (W)
Barack Obama's recent successful bid for the Presidency has reminded Americans of the strong links between African-Americans and Africans and of the inter-
national dimensions of the struggle for racial justice. This struggle has its roots in the post-World War II transformation of the world associated with the decoloni-
zation struggles led by individuals like Kwame Nkrumah, Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi, Franz Fanon, C.L.R. James, Walter Rodney and Aime Cesaire.
This course will examine this movement, focusing on activists in the Caribbean and Africa, the new ideas and cultural movements they inspired (Pan-Africanism,
Negritude), their organizational activities in London and Paris, and their success in breaking free of European imperialism only to be confronted with American
and Russian Cold War rivalry. By comparing and contrasting four different experiences of independence--British Guiana, the French Caribbean, Ghana, and
South Africa--this course will grapple with the ways in which racism, political power, and cultural difference affected relations between Blacks, mulattoes,
whites, and Indians in these countries as they fought for independence. Students will videochat with some of their peers in South Africa on a biweekly basis and
do an oral history project on American anti-apartheid activities with an eye to seeing the similarities and differences between U.S. and South African race relations
and developing empathy for their peers abroad. The comparative and transatlantic scope of this course, combined with its focus on race relations, power, and
privilege helps it meet the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative.

They are offered in either small or large formats, depending on the individual course.
HIST 201(F) History Behind the Headlines (D)
What is the history behind today's major events? And what are some of the differing perspectives and interpretations around the world on how to address some of
the most significant issues that face us all? This course will challenge students to think globally and historically about the present by introducing the methods and
conceptual tools historians use to understand the past and how that may lead to a better appreciation of contemporary society. Students will be encouraged to
become more critical readers of the media and thus better assess when and how history is used and abused in the public sphere. Throughout the semester, mem-
bers of the History Department will visit the class and address how their field (e.g. East Asian, Latin American, African-American History) is represented in the
media and political discourse. The theme for 2009-10 will be citizenship. Because of its commitment to explore how people in different societies respond to the
pressing issues of the day and how people in various corners of the world are redefining and rethinking notions of citizenship, this course is part of the Exploring
Diversity Initiative (EDI).
Format: lecture/discussion. Students will be required to keep a media journal and follow the news in various media outlets around the world. Evaluation will be

HIST 203(S) A Survey of Modern African History (Same as Africana Studies 203)
This course surveys the history of 19th and 20th century Africa. The first section of the course focuses on the European conquest of Africa and the dynamics of
colonial rule--especially its socio-economic and cultural consequences. The second section discusses the ways in which the rising tide of African nationalism, in
the form of labor strikes and guerrilla wars, ushered out colonialism. The third section examines the postcolonial states, focusing on the politics of development,
recent civil wars in countries like Rwanda, and the growing AIDS epidemics. The last section surveys the history of Apartheid in South Africa up to 1994.
Course materials include fiction, poetry, memoirs, videos, newspaper articles, and outstanding recent scholarship. The course is structured around discussions.
History 203 is an introductory course, and requires no prior knowledge of African History.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two 7- to 10-page papers, one exam, and unspecified number of pop quizzes.

HIST 213 Modern China, 1600-Present (Same as Asian Studies 213) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Observers may be struck by the apparent contradictions of contemporary China: market reforms undertaken by a nominally Communist government, extremes of
urban wealth and rural poverty, increasing participation in the international community and intensifying nationalist rhetoric. This course will examine China's
historical engagement with the modern world in order to gain perspective on our current views. It will cover the Qing (1644-1911) dynastic order, encounters with
Western and Japanese imperialism, the rise of Chinese nationalism, Republican and Communist revolutions, the "other Chinas" of Taiwan and Hong Kong,
economic liberalization, and globalization.

The ascension of powerful warlords in the late 1500s brought to an end a century of constant warfare and laid the foundation for the Tokugawa bakufu, the
military government headed by the Tokugawa shogun that would rule Japan for almost three hundred years. This course will introduce students to the extraordi-
nary changes of the years between the establishment of the Tokugawa bakufu in 1603 and its collapse in 1868, an era characterized by relative peace and stability,
periods of economic growth as well as stagnation, the growth of cities and towns, the flourishing of urban culture, and the decline of the samurai. We will focus on
the political and social history of early modern Japan, including topics such as the establishment of the Tokugawa order, the nature of the political system, urban-
ization, popular culture, rural life, gender and sexuality, class and status, religion, and the fall of the Tokugawa bakufu. Assigned materials will include govern-

various "ordinary people" have lived through the extraordinary changes of the past century and a half. Through the perspectives of ordinary people, be it a young
girl working in a cotton textile factory in the 1920s, a wartime soldier, or a teenager of the early twenty-first century, issues of national identity and nationalism,
democracy, work, gender, family, youth and consumerism will be addressed. Reading materials will include anthropological studies, fiction, films, political docu-

HIST 222 Greek History (Same as Classics 222) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Ancient Greece has been thought to embody the origins of Western civilization in its institutions, values, and thought; it has been seen as the infancy of modern
society, with the attributes of innocence, purity, and the infant's staggering capacity for exploration and learning; it has been interpreted as an essentially primitive,
violent culture with a thin veneer of rationality; and it has been celebrated as the rational culture par excellence. The study of ancient Greece indeed requires an
interpretive framework, yet Greek culture and history have defied most attempts to articulate one. We will make our attempt in this course by investigating ancient
Greece as a set of cultures surprisingly foreign to us, as it so often was to its own intellectual elite. But we will also come to appreciate the rich and very real
connections between ancient Greek and modern Western civilization. The course will begin with Bronze Age-Greece and the earliest developments in Greek
culture, and will conclude with the spread of Greek influence into Asia through the conquests of Alexander the Great. We will explore topics such as the aristo-
cratic heritage of the city-state, the effects of pervasive war on Greek society, the competitive spirit in political and religious life, the confrontations with the East,
the relationship of intellectual culture to Greek culture as a whole, Greek dependence on slavery, and the diversity of political and social forms in the Greek world.
The readings will concentrate on original sources, including historical writings, philosophy, poetry, and oratory. The class will meet once a week for a lecture, and
will divide into two discussion sections for the second meeting of the week.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class discussions, a midterm, a final exam, and a medium-length paper.

HIST 223 Roman History (Same as Classics 223) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
The study of Roman history involves questions central to the development of Western institutions, religion, and modes of thought. Scholars have looked to Rome
both for actual antecedents of European cultural development and for paradigmatic scenes illustrating what they felt were cultural universals. Yet Roman history
also encompasses the most far-reaching experience of diverse cultures, beliefs, and practices known in the Western tradition until perhaps contemporary times. A
close analysis of Roman history on its own terms shows the complex and fascinating results of an ambitious, self-confident nation's encounter both with unex-
pected events and crises at home, and with other peoples. As this course addresses the history of Rome from its mythologized beginnings through the reign of the
emperor Constantine, it will place special emphasis on the impressive Roman ability to turn the unexpected into a rich source of cultural development, as well as
the complex tendency later to interpret such ad hoc responses as predestined and inevitable. The Romans also provide a vivid portrait of the relationship between
power and self-confidence on the one hand, and violence and ultimate disregard for dissent and difference on the other. Readings for this course will concentrate
on a wide variety of original sources, and there will be a strong emphasis on the problems of historical interpretation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on weekly brief in-class response papers, one 8- to 10-page paper, a midterm, and a final exam.

HIST 225 The Middle Ages (Same as Religion 216) (Not offered 2009-2010)
This course explores the development of European and Mediterranean civilizations during the thousand-year period known as the "Middle Ages." At the begin-
ning of this period the Romans ruled a massive empire that stretched from Britain to north Africa and from Spain to Iraq. A millennium later, this classical and
pagan world had broken apart into three successor civilizations: medieval Europe, the Byzantine empire, and the Islamic world. This course investigates how this
momentous transformation occurred. We will examine such topics as relations between Romans and "barbarians," the spread of Christianity and Islam, the
development of kingdoms and empires, the Vikings and crusades, saints and religious reformers, art and architecture, cities and trade, the persecution of Jews and
heretics, as well as the Black Death and Italian Renaissance.

social and economic change, and of great intellectual ferment. Topics include the French and Russian Revolutions, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, the Indus-
trial Revolution, German and Italian Unification, European imperialist expansion, processes of secularization and religious revival, and the origins of World War
I. With an eye toward exploring the origins of today's complex attitudes toward race, ethnicity, and gender, the course will also investigate racial thought, anti-

HIST 228(S) Europe in the Twentieth Century
This course introduces students to the history of Europe from before the First World to the present. During this period Europe witnessed two world wars, the
largest pandemic in recorded history, numerous civil conflicts, the fall of capitalist colonial empires, and the rise and fall of a communist empire. Through a
combination of films, artistic works, philosophical interventions, and historical texts, we will look at what made the last century both the most violent and the most
productive in Europe's history. By discussing various possible ways of organizing twentieth-century European history (the Cold War, decolonization, expanded
suffrage, scientific progress, etc), we will develop a variety of lenses through which we can read assigned works and grasp both the contours and complexity of
Europe's past.

China and the Opium Wars, and the Scramble for Africa. The class will both compare European societies, especially insofar as their rival imperial policies
contributed to World War I, and European and non-European cultures as they confronted one another for the first time. Issues to be explored include imperialism
and its relationship to Christianity, gender, racism, and economic profit. In the second half of the course, we will examine two of the most dramatic cases of
decolonization, Gandhi and Nehru's independence movement in India and Patrice Lumumba's torturous struggle for independence in the Belgian Congo. The
comparative scope of this course, combined with the attention it pays to the ways in which power and privilege determined relations between Europeans and
Asians, Africans, and Latin Americans helps it meet the requirements for the Exploring Diversity Initiative.

What does it mean to be a Jew? The vexed question of Jewish identity emerged at the end of the eighteenth century in Europe and has dominated Jewish history
throughout the modern period. Although Jewish emancipation and citizenship followed different paths in France and the German states, in both cases Jews were
confronted by unprecedented opportunities for integration into non-Jewish society and unprecedented challenges to Jewish communal life. This course will
introduce students to the major social, cultural, religious, and political transformations that shaped the lives of Europe's Jews from the outbreak of the French
Revolution to the aftermath of World War II. We will explore such topics as emancipation, Jewish diversity, the rise of religious denominations within Judaism,
competing political ideologies, Jewish-gentile relations, the role of Jewish women, Jewish responses to Nazism, and the situation of Jews in the immediate post-
war period. In addition to broad historical treatments, course materials will include memoirs and diaries.

HIST 240(F) Muscovy and the Russian Empire
Between the fourteenth and the seventeenth centuries the princes and political elite of Muscovy created a vast multi-national empire in Eastern Europe and Asia.
Over the next 150 years their imperial heirs transformed and extended this empire, to the point that on the eve of the Crimean War (1853-1855) many believed it to
be the most powerful state in Europe. But defeat in the war exposed the weakness of the imperial regime and helped to provoke a process of state-led reform that
failed to avert, and may well have contributed to, the collapse of the regime in the February Revolution of 1917. Using a combination of primary and secondary
sources, this course will explore the character of the Muscovite and the Russian empires and the forces, processes, and personalities that shaped their formation,
expansion, and, in the latter case, decline.

This course will examine salient issues in the history of the independent nations of Latin America. The first section of the course will focus on the turbulent
formation of nation-states over the course of the nineteenth century. In this regard the course will analyze the social and economic changes of the period up to
World War I and the possibilities they offered for both political order and disorder. Key topics addressed will include caudillismo, the role of the Church in politics,
economic dependency and development, and the place of indigenous and African Latin-American peoples in new nations. The second section will move us to
questions in twentieth-century Latin-American history, including industrialization and urbanization; the emergence of workers' and women's movements and the
rise of mass politics; militarism, democracy, and authoritarian governments; the influence of the U.S. in the region; and the construction of cultural modernism in
these "Third World" societies. Here and throughout the course we will strive for an understanding of how social conflicts shaped and were shaped by economic
and political forces.

nations from the slave colonies of the not-so-distant past. HIST/AFR 248 will show that though they may be picturesque vacation destinations, the islands of the
Caribbean have played a central role in global history. In particular, this course will introduce students to the Caribbean through sustained attention to two simulta-
neous and related long-term developments: the maintenance of European and North American imperial enterprises and the elaboration of racial ideologies around
the diversity that has characterized the island populations. Through this prism, we will explore issues such as colonialism, piracy, sugar revolutions, slavery and
emancipation, national independence, tourism, and Caribbean migrations. Cuba, Haiti, and Jamaica will be the main areas under consideration for this semester;
however, we will also examine texts from other islands such as the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Martinique when appropriate. Sources will include
speeches, song lyrics, films, testimonios, and other primary documents that shed light on the history of Caribbean nations.

HIST 262(F) The United States and the World, 1776 to 1914 (Same as Leadership Studies 262)
From its foundation in 1776 to the beginning of World War I in 1914, the United States developed a complex of ideas for understanding--and methods for
securing --its place in the world. During this period, the nation's diplomacy went through several phases as it made the transition from a young republic strug-
gling to conduct its diplomacy, to an expansionist power in the first half of the nineteenth century, to an emerging world power in the aftermath of the Civil War,
and then to an imperialist power after the Spanish-American War. Amidst these events, U.S. statesmen and citizens constantly debated the country's proper
diplomatic role and struggled to construct and propagate a unique American ideology, as well as an advantageous geo-strategic position, on the global stage.
Debates about foreign relations were imbued with questions of race, nation, independence, religion, economy, law, gender, and geographic expansion; indeed,
defining U.S. foreign relations was a means of defining the nation itself. Through a variety of primary sources and scholarly books and articles, this course will
examine U.S. relations with external powers as well as the interactions that occurred between U.S. domestic and foreign policy during this period.

HIST 263(S) The United States and the World, 1914 to the Present (Same as Leadership Studies 263)
World War I altered the world's geostrategic balance and ushered in a new era for U.S. foreign relations. The self-identified isolationist power would emerge as a
hegemon, no longer able or content to rely upon its geographic position to protect it from global entanglement. Some have called this the "Wilsonian Century," as
Woodrow Wilson led the charge to involve the United States in a new international order. This new order did not materialize immediately after the Treaty of
Versailles in 1919, especially as the world descended into economic depression. During and after World War II, though, the U.S. adopted activist methods of
spreading self-determination, democracy, and capitalist models of development and free trade around the world. This became all the more critical as European
empires disintegrated and decolonizing countries looked to the adversarial superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, for competing models of devel-
opment and modern forms of government. Through a variety of primary sources and scholarly books and articles, this course will explore U.S. relations with the
world from World War I to the current war in Iraq. In addition to official U.S. policy, it will consider how international events have shaped American society and
culture and, in turn, how domestic factors have influenced American foreign policy.

States. Economically, culturally, and politically, African Americans had a profound effect on the historical landscape of this nation. The experience of slavery
necessarily dominates this history and it is the contours and nuances of slavery that give this course its focus. We will explore the influence of African culture on
early America, the role of gender in the American slave labor system, the development of racial classification in North America, and the cultural and intellectual
significance of the abolitionist movement. Our readings will include primary sources and secondary literature. Class meetings will combine lecture and discus-

Koreans, Filipinos, Indians, and Southeast Asians in America, and the historical reasons why they came to the US and their subsequent interactions with other
ethno-racial groups in the United States. Topics include the anti-Asian exclusion movements, the wartime incarceration of Japanese Americans, the increase of
Asian immigration after the 1965 Immigration Act and the war in Viet Nam, and impact of the events of September 11, 2001 on Asian American communities.
These themes and others will be explored through the use of historical texts, primary documents, novels, memoirs, and films. This is an EDI course because it

This class offers an overview of the African presence in and influence on European politics and culture since their appearance as slaves in the sixteenth century.
Despite such inauspicious beginnings, Africans played an important role in the abolitionist movements in England and France in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries and challenged European imperialism in Africa at the end of the century. During the twentieth century, pan-africanism, Ngritude, decolonization and
the non-aligned movement developed in Europe's major capitals, where African and African-American artists and musicians interacted in novel ways to put
Europe on the forefront of developments in modern art, literature, jazz and world music. Since World War II, widespread immigration of Africans--particularly
North Africans and West Indians of African descent--to Europe has deeply changed the character of European societies. From Hottentot Venus to Josephine
Baker, from Mary Prince to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, this course will use the writings of intellectuals and leaders like Senghor, Fanon, and C.L.R. James--as well as film,
music, and literature--to explore the ways in which Africans have transformed Europe in the modern era.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on informed class participation, a midterm exam, a final exam, and a research paper.

MAJOR SEMINARS (301)
Major seminars explore the nature and practice of history, are required for the degree in History, and are normally restricted to junior History majors. Although
these seminars vary in topic and approach, each focuses on the discipline of history itself--on the debates over how to approach the past, on questions of the status
of different kinds of evidence and how to use it, on the purpose of the study of history. Focusing on questions of methodology, epistemology, and historiography,
161
these courses ask: What kind of knowledge do historians claim to produce? What does it mean to study the past? How do historians approach the project of
studying the past? Each year several major seminars will be offered. Students who plan to study abroad during their junior year may take their Major Seminar in
the spring semester of their sophomore year, and those planning to be away for the whole of their junior year are strongly encouraged to do so.
HIST 301A(F) Approaching the Past: History, Theory, Practice
This course will explore how the discipline of `History' has come to assume its present form and how a number of historians since the 1820s have understood
their craft. We will begin by discussing the work of three great nineteenth-century historians (Macaulay, Marx, and Ranke) who believed that historical "truth"
existed and could, with skill, be deciphered. Next we will explore the philosophy and practice of the cultural and social historians of the 1960s/1970s, comparing
and contrasting it with that of their nineteenth-century predecessors. We will then consider the work of those recent theorists who have tried to refute historians'
claims to be able to capture the "truth" of the past, focusing on the state of the field in the wake of challenges posed to its epistemological foundations by "post-
modernism." We will conclude with an assessment of the state of the discipline today. In general, we will be less concerned with "the past" than with what
historians do with "the past." Consequently, we will focus primarily on those abstract, philosophical assumptions that have informed the practice of history.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a 250-word position statement ("What is History?"), two 9- to 11-page interpretive essays,
and a take-home final exam.
Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15-19). Restricted to History majors.

HIST 301B(F) Approaching the Past: Documentary Practices
Comprised of photographs, oral history, narratives, folklore, films, fiction, music, poetry, art and other forms, documentary provides ways for audiences to access
stories that would go untold but for the work of the documentarian: Jacob Riis' turn of the century photographs of New York's Lower East Side, Agee and
Walker's study of white southern poverty, Danny Lyon's photos of the civil rights movement, or Spike Lee's film about the murder of four black girls in Birming-
ham, Alabama. From its beginnings, documentary served to engender a progressive agenda by projecting the voices of the voiceless in order to illuminate the
need for social change and spur the audience to action. But documentary also provides a way to access history, both the setting where the document was created
and the subject it describes. This course examines the historical development of documentary forms, reviews and critiques the work of specific documentarians,
facilitates historical research in non-traditional sources, and encourages students to develop a documentary skill.
Format: seminar. Requirements: Students write two short papers, and the course culminates with students creating their own documentary projects.

HIST 301C Approaching the Past: Practices of Modern History (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
What is history? What is it that historians do? In this course, students will explore questions of how and why we historians practice our craft. The first section of
the course will examine how historians come to know, think about, and understand the past. Issues of the nature of historical "truth," objectivity and bias, types of
sources, and uses of theory will be discussed. Next, we will address the ways in which historians write about the past, considering the influence of postmodernism
on historical narratives, and historical film. Finally, we will examine the uses of history, including ethical and moral ramifications of our work, history education,
and the construction of historical memory. The class will meet once a week, and each session will focus on some theoretical material as well as readings that
concretely illustrate the methodological issues at stake. These readings will be drawn from a broad range of topics, such as the Great Depression, the Pacific War,
the Holocaust, and the assassination of JFK.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, response papers, short essays, and a final paper.

HIST 301D Approaching the Past: Is History Eurocentric? (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
The modern historical profession is very much a European creation, originating in the Age of Enlightenment. Championing reason and challenging religious
views of the past, the Philosophes linked the new secular study of man and his society to a view of historical progress. Some have argued that the very nature of
the historical discipline is Eurocentric, based as it is on Western concepts of reason, science, and historical evolution which privilege European history at the
expense of its non-Western counterparts. In this course, we will study some of the important spokesmen for historical progress (Voltaire, Condorcet, Marx, von
Ranke) as well as some of their important critics. The first half of the course will survey the history of the historical profession from the Enlightenment to the
present. In the second half of the course, we will read some of the great works of history which have attempted to explain the rise of the west, grappling with how
and to what extent these interpretations are Eurocentric.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, two 10- to 12-page papers, and a final exam.

HIST 301E Approaching the Past: Three Historians of the Dark Ages (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This History 301 seminar investigates the nature of History through the three most important historical writers of the so-called European Dark Ages: Gregory of
Tours (d. 594), a Gallo-Roman aristocrat and bishop who chronicled the bloody feuds of the early Frankish kings and queens; the Venerable Bede (d. 735), a
Benedictine monk who famously narrated the conversion of Anglo-Saxon England from paganism to Christianity; and Einhard (d. 840), the biographer of the
great emperor Charlemagne. For each of these early medieval authors, we will seek to understand not only how he conceived of and wrote about the past, but also
how modern historians have tried to use his surviving writings as evidence to construct their own historical arguments and narratives. In this way, our examination
of three historians of the Dark Ages will become an exploration into historical methodology, historiography, epistemology, and the limits of historical knowledge.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, short weekly response papers, and several longer papers.
Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15-19). Restricted to History majors.

HIST 301F(S) Approaching the Past: Remembering American History
Much of what we know and understand about American history is rooted in the received narrative of our national history, a history that is constructed of individu-
al, collective, and a national memory of the past and its meanings. This course will examine some forms through which American historical memory is presented
and (re)presented, such as monuments, museums, novels, film, photographs, and scholarly historical writing, by considering a number of pivotal events, institu-
tions, or eras in American history. Potential topics are slavery, race, and the Civil War; westward expansion; the Great Depression; World War II; the Sixties; the
war in Viet Nam; and the events and aftermath of September 11, 2001.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on weekly response papers, a book review, an exercise with the Williams College Museum of Art, and a final project to
be completed in consultation with the professor.
Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15-19). Restricted to History majors.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W WONG
HIST 301G(S) Approaching the Past: Writing the Past
"History" refers to the aggregate of past events as well as to the branch of knowledge that seeks to understand those past events. Whereas history courses often
take as their content the first of these two meanings of history, focusing on the politics, society, and culture of a particular place in a particular historical era, this
course will examine history's often concealed "other" meaning: the practices of historians, their methods and assumptions. In so doing, this course aims to un-
settle history majors' own assumptions about what history "is" and what historians "do". How do historians reconstruct the past, and how and why have their
approaches to sources, theories, and narrative strategies changed over time? And on a deeper level, how have historians' suppositions changed--if they have
changed--about the nature of historical truth, knowledge, and the value of history to the societies in which they wrote? Taking history-writing itself as our object
of study, over the course of the semester we will read the work of twelve, quite different historians from the classical to the modern era. Each week in our seminar
meetings, we will subject these texts to a careful reading in order to understand and assess these historians' theories and practices.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly critical response papers to the assigned reading, and a final paper. Enrollment limit: 19

1921 and the Pahlavi government in Iran. We will evaluate the revolutions of 1958 and 1978-9 and compare the lives and careers of Saddam Hussein and Ayatol-
lah Khomeini. The tragic Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88 will also be discussed. Finally, the political future of these countries will be assessed.

HIST 311(F) The United States and the Middle East (Same as Leadership Studies 310)
At the turn of the twentieth century, the United States was considered a benign superpower in the Middle East. Americans were known as "innocents abroad" for
their educational and philanthropic work. From a distance, American society was admired for its affluence and freedom, and Middle Eastern politicians eagerly
sought American advice and assistance. Today, however, the situation could hardly be more different. This course will examine the remarkable transformation of
American involvement in the Middle East. Significant cultural and political encounters of the latter half of the twentieth century will be assessed in order to
identify how the United States has approached the region and consider the multifaceted and sometimes ambivalent reactions of people in the Middle East to
increasing U.S. presence. It will also explore the difficulty the United States has experienced in balancing diverse, and sometimes conflicting, foreign policy
interests, and will evaluate what may account for the increasing level of antagonism and mistrust on both sides.

Although sometimes claimed as part of a set of immutable "Asian values," the Chinese family has not remained fixed or stable over time. In this course, we will
use the framework of "family" to gain insight into gender, generational, and sexual roles in different historical periods. Beginning in the late imperial period
(16th-18th Centuries), we will examine the religious, marriage, sexual, and childrearing practices associated with the "orthodox" Confucian family. We will then
explore heterodox practices, debates over and critiques of the family system, and the substantial history of family reform efforts in twentieth century China.

An unabating tension between conflict and cooperation has been an undercurrent of U.S.-Japan relations in the past 150 years, at times erupting into clashes
reaching the scale of world war and at times allowing for measured collaboration. We will explore the U.S.-Japan relationship from the perspectives of both
countries with a focus on how culture, domestic concerns, economic and political aims, international contexts, and race have helped shape its course and nature.
This course will fulfill the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative by examining not just the diplomatic relationship between the U.S. and Japan, but
also how various types of interactions have influenced the dynamics of power between these two countries and have shaped the ways in which each country has
understood and portrayed the other. Topics will include early U.S.-Japan encounters, the road to World War II, the politics and social history of the Occupation,
trade relations, and the U.S.-Japan security alliance. Contemporary topics will also be discussed and due attention will be given to the larger context of U.S.-East
Asia relations.

Visionary, opportunist, reformer, tyrant, demagogue, popular champion: concise characterization of influential leaders is often irresistible. But placing leaders in
their much less easily encapsulated political, social, and religious contexts reveals them to be far more complicated and challenging subjects. Among the ques-
tions that will guide our study of Greek leadership: Was the transformative leader in a Greek city always an unexpected one, arising outside of the prevailing
political and/or social systems? To what extent did the prevailing systems determine the nature of transformative as well as of normative leadership? How did
various political and social norms contribute to legitimating particular kinds of leader? After studying such leaders as the "tyrants" who prevailed in many Greek
cities of both the archaic and classical eras, then Athenian leaders like Solon, Cleisthenes, Cimon, Pericles, Cleon, and Demosthenes, and Spartans like Cleo-
163
menes, Leonidas, Brasidas, and Lysander, we will focus on Alexander the Great, whose unique accomplishments transformed every aspect of Greek belief about
leadership, national boundaries, effective government, the role of the governed, and the legitimacy of power. Readings will include accounts of leadership and
government by ancient Greek authors (e.g. Homer, Solon, Herodotus, Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle, Demosthenes, all in translation) and contemporary historians
and political theorists.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on contributions to class discussions, three short papers (4-6 pages each), a midterm exam, and an oral

HIST 325 The World of Charlemagne (Same as Religion 219) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
The medieval emperor Charlemagne (768-814) was known by contemporaries as the "Father of Europe," and in recent years he has become the symbol of the
European Union. Thus for twelve hundred years people have believed that Charlemagne and his royal dynasty-the Carolingians-played a decisive role in the
shaping of the western world. This course seeks to understand why that should be the case. We will explore how Charlemagne and his family created the first
medieval empire out of the diverse peoples and territories of continental Europe: not only through warfare and military might, but also through Christianity and
the Church, educational and cultural reforms, government and law, art and architecture, and a fundamental reorganization of the economy and society. Studying
these aspects of the Carolingian age will enable us to see the enduring contributions of his family to the formation of Europe as well as the shortcomings and
failures of their empire.

HIST 326(S) War in European History
From the ancient world to the twentieth century, war has always played an important part in European history. Europeans have not only constantly been at war
with other Europeans, but also with neighboring cultures and, indeed, most peoples around the globe. This course will introduce students to the history of Euro-
pean warfare from its origins in the classical and medieval periods to its maturation in the early modern period (1450-1815), and its disastrous culmination in the
nationalist struggles of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Has there been a distinctively "European Way of War" from the beginning? How do we explain
failure and success in European wars? What exactly happened at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war? And what caused changes in the organiza-
tion and waging of European war from one period to the next?

HIST 327 Knighthood and Chivalry (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Today the terms "knighthood" and "chivalry" evoke romantic images of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Throughout the Middle Ages, howev-
er, knighthood and chivalry described the warlike and violent world of the European ruling class: the nobility. A knight was an armored warrior on horseback, and
chivalry described his bellicose aristocratic culture. This course seeks to understand the origins, nature, and transformations of knighthood and chivalry during the
Middle Ages. We will explore such topics as the formation of the European nobility, the emergence of the ethos of knighthood, Christian lay piety, family struc-
ture and inheritance patterns, the changing status of women, warfare and crusades, life in castles, relations with peasants, jousting and tournaments, courtly love,
chivalric literature, and the emergence of "civilized" courtly manners.

Today the nation-state is the accepted form of political organization across the globe. But in Antiquity and the Middle Ages, it was large, multi-ethnic empires
rather than nations that dominated the map of the known world. This course explores the nature of empire and imperial rule in the late antique and medieval world
through several case studies: the late Roman empire of Constantine the Great, the Byzantine empire of Justinian, the Frankish empire of Charlemagne, the Islamic
caliphate of Harun al Rashid, and the German Reich of Otto the Great. In examining these premodern world empires, we will investigate the nature of imperial
politics, government, ideology, warfare, cultural life, and economic organization, as well as the causes for the rise and fall of empires.

HIST 329 The Christianization of Europe (Same as Religion 214) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
The most important development in the history of Europe was its conversion to Christianity during Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages. In the fourth
century the Roman emperors embraced Christianity as the new religion of their Mediterranean empire, and in subsequent centuries bishops, monks, and mission-
aries gradually converted the barbarian peoples of Europe to the new religion. In the process, Christianity transformed the peoples and kingdoms it came into
contact with and bequeathed to them the legacy of the Roman imperial past. This course explores how the late Roman empire became Christian and how Chris-
tianity influenced the polities and societies of early medieval Europe. In the process we will explore such topics as the emergence of Christian doctrine and
monasticism, the lives and thoughts of the Church Fathers, the role of saints and missionaries, the function of relics and miracles, the formation of the Church and
Papacy, the politics of conversion of kings and kingdoms, the development of Christian art and literature, and the impact of Christianity on everyday religious
practices and beliefs.

This course provides an examination of the uneven development of a revolutionary tradition in France. We will follow the attempts to define, deny, foreclose, and
revise the Revolution from its explosion in 1789 through the end of the Napoleonic regime in 1815. A strong historiographic focus will direct our attention to the
gendered nature of the revolutionary project; the tension between liberty and equality that runs throughout French history; the intersection of race and citizenship
in both the French and Haitian revolutions; and the plausibility of competing social, political, and cultural interpretations of the Revolution.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a midterm examination, several response papers, and a final essay. (This course can be taken,

This course will introduce students to some of the most significant and exciting social, artistic, intellectual, and political developments in fin-de-sicle Europe
(1870 to 1914). "Fin-de-sicle" is a concept that denotes not only a historical period--the end of a century--but refers to a consciousness of living in a time of
accelerated change and crisis. Intellectuals and artists of the decades we will be examining were preoccupied with "degeneration," loss of innocence, meaning,
164
morality, and the inner self. They were simultaneously fascinated and horrified by technological innovation, emergent political and ideological currents, and the
challenges to traditional values and identities posed by them. After a survey of political upheavals during the European fin-de- sicle, the course will focus on
three metropolises consecutively: Vienna, Paris, and St. Petersburg. Through analyses of historical literature, novels, music, visual art, and the seminal texts of
psychoanalysis we will explore how the self, public life, gender relations, sexuality, and aesthetics were conceived and re-imagined in each city, and bring to light
the sensibilities and culture they shared.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, an oral presentation, two short critical essays based on class readings, and a final research

HIST 338(F) The History of the Holocaust (Same as Jewish Studies 338)
In twenty-first century America, the murder of approximately six million European Jews by Nazi Germany remains a central event in our political, moral, and
cultural universe. Nevertheless, the Holocaust still confounds historians' efforts to understand both the motivations of the perpetrators and the suffering of the
victims. In this course, we will study the origins and implementation of the Holocaust from the divergent perspectives of perpetrators and victims. Our goal will be
to investigate deeply the interaction of individual lives and world historical events. We will also examine the Holocaust within the larger context of the history of
World War II in Europe and historians' debates about Germany's exterminatory war aims. Course materials will include diaries, speeches, bureaucratic docu-
ments, memoirs, films, and historical scholarship.

HIST 342(F) Creating Nations and Nationalism in Latin America (D)
As it emerged from Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule between the 1790s and 1890s, Latin America spawned some of the earliest self-conscious nationalisms
in the world. With particular emphasis on the interplay of race and ethnicity, regional economic and political spaces, and gender identities, this course will ex-
amine the construction and continuing life of the modern nations and nationalisms of the region. The aim here is double. First, we will seek to understand the
historical processes that created nationalisms and nation-states in distinct cases, including Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Nicaragua, Peru, and Chile. At the same
time, we will use those individual country studies to revise or better understand major theories about nations and nationalism--theories that almost always take as
their starting point the study of past and present European states. By carrying out these dual tasks, the course will fulfill the requirements of the Exploring Diversi-
ty Initiative: we will carry out a comparative history of Latin American nations' internal and international relations of power and will try to construct new concep-
tualizations of that history. Our use of comparisons between countries' modern histories, in other words, will build toward better understandings of how different
groups have "fit" or not in nation-building projects and how such processes "fit" or not in existing theoretical literatures.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a take-home midterm exam, and two essays.

HIST 345(S) "In Our Own Backyard?" U.S. and Latin American Relations (Same as Africana Studies 345 and Leadership Studies 345)
This course examines the relations between the United States and Latin America during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We will explore a variety of U.S.
military interventions in the region, including U.S. participation in the Spanish-Cuban-American War, the occupation of Haiti, and the CIA's role in the overthrow
of President Salvador Allende in Chile. We will look for consistencies and changes over time, weighing the role of ideology, national security, economic interests,
and cultural factors in the creation and outcomes of U.S. policy. Readings will consist of a variety of primary source materials, mostly U.S. government docu-
ments but also letters and memoirs by U.S. policy-makers. All of the documents are in English, but students with a reading knowledge of Spanish will be encour-
aged to investigate other primary sources. In addition to the actions and motivations of officials in Washington, we will also consider how ordinary Americans
interpreted U.S. relations with Latin America. Therefore, the course will investigate how young soldiers, African Americans, and women saw their roles as
occupiers, allies, and the vehicle of modern civilization in the region. History 345 will also consider Latin American initiatives and responses to U.S. intervention,
from attempts by nationalist regimes in Chile, Cuba, Guatemala, and Nicaragua to find an alternative to dependence on the United States, to critiques by Latin
American intellectuals concerning U.S. cultural influences.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, short (2-3 page) weekly writing assignments, and a final research paper (15-20 pages in length).
The final paper will be based on primary source research about a particular U.S. intervention in Latin American.

HIST 346(S) History of Modern Brazil (D)
Brazil has been "the country of the future" longer than it has been an independent nation. This course will introduce students to the many contradictions hinted at
in that label--for beyond a patriotic boosterism, the phrase also suggests frustrations that Brazilians have felt, as their country failed to reach what they considered
its magnificent potential. While they can celebrate their World Cup victories or the size of their economy (among the ten largest in the world, and heavily industri-
alized for a "developing nation"), they also have to acknowledge a series of troubling paradoxes: the mixture of fluidity and hierarchy apparent in racial and
gender relations; the persistence of political authoritarianism and rampant social violence amidst struggles for citizenship; the endless inventiveness of Brazilian
music, religion, and futebol along with government attempts to co-opt such forms of popular culture. Combining cultural, political, and social analyses, this
course fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative requirement by examining a range of written texts and other sources to understand these and other themes in the
lives of Brazilians of different social identities and political standings since Independence.

HIST 353 North American Indian History: Pre-Contact to the Present (Same as Environmental Studies 353) (Not offered 2009-2010)
In most renditions of North American history, Indian people only make cameo appearances as warriors or victims bound to disappear in the face of relentless
Euro-American imperialism. All too often, the complexity and diversity of American Indian historical experiences and Indian peoples' role in shaping the politi-
cal, economic, and cultural history of the United States and Canada remain unexplored. In this course, we will examine the historical significance of North
American Indian actions and experiences from the "pre-Columbian" era to the present. Our approach will be both chronological and thematic and will pay close
attention to the methods scholars have used to reconstruct American Indian perspectives. Our themes will include: Indian resistance and adaptation to European
165
colonial invasions and evangelizing efforts; diplomacy, warfare, and the evolution of North American geopolitics; the transformation of Euro-American and
Indian material cultures; the construction and transformation of colonial and national identities; Indian responses to Euro-American uses and abuses of "Indian-

HIST 359 Autobiography as History: An American Character? (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Historians have long debated whether it makes sense to speak of distinctive national characters-tendencies to think and behave in particular ways that are endemic
to specific nations or peoples. In the United States, with its high degree of racial and ethnic diversity, such notions seem especially problematic. Through a reading
of selected autobiographies supplemented by other materials, we will seek to test the validity of various conceptions of "American" national character by looking
at how individuals in different eras and circumstances have attempted to understand and interpret their own life experiences. Readings will include autobiogra-
phies by William Bradford, Benjamin Franklin, Frederick Douglass, Mary Chestnut, Jan Addams, Martin Luther King, Michael Herr, Richard Rodriguez, Max-
ine Hong Kingston, and others.

HIST 360(S) The Spanish-American Wars (Same as Leadership Studies 360) (D)
This course contextualizes the Spanish-American War of 1898--often perceived as the United States' initiation into the realm of imperialism--in the longer
history of Spanish imperial decline and U.S. ascendancy in the Americas. It will explore the consequences of this geopolitical realignment from the perspective of
the Spanish as well as Spain's Latin American subjects who broke free from colonial rule only to find themselves, in one historian's words, "under America."
Readings--including scholarly books, articles, and primary documents--will also investigate a wide range of U.S. perspectives on the nation's rapid continental
expansion in the nineteenth century that was facilitated by Spain's retreat from the Americas. By 1898, the dissolution of the Spanish empire and the United
States' quest for hemispheric hegemony and world power culminated in the Spanish-American War and the advent of an American empire. The conflicts this war
generated within U.S. society and between the U.S., Spain, Latin American and Caribbean nations, and the Philippines will constitute the focus of the second part
of the course. This course fulfils the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative, as students will examine the struggles that emerged within and between the
countries in question over which groups would gain and lose social, economic, and political power and privilege as they confronted the power vacuum created by
the collapse of the Spanish Empire.

and Asia. Through primary documents including memoirs, oral histories, novels, photographs, and films, as well as the current scholarship on the war, we will
explore a range of experiences of Americans during the war, both on the American homefront and in combat. The course material will play special attention to the
racial, ethnic, gender, sexual, class, and regional relationships that were affected by the war. Themes include the mobilization of the war effort, women and war
production, the incarceration of Japanese Americans, the resistance of African Americans to segregation and inequality, the impact of combat on soldiers, the
decision to use the atomic bomb and responses to its use, the enduring legacy of the Holocaust, how the war enabled the United States to emerge as a superpower
in the postwar era, and various issues involving the historical memory of the war. This course fulfills the requirements for the Exploring Diversity Initiative
because it examines how different racial, ethnic, and gendered/sexualized groups were affected by the war, how they transformed American society, and how
America's status in the world changed after the war, bringing about new relations between Americans and those they fought with and against during the war.

This course will consider whether and how the 1980s are coming into view as history. Conventional wisdom views the 1980s as being defined by selfishness,
greed, and materialism, but that decade also saw society engaged in serious debates about individual and social responsibility, the relationship between the state
and society, and about America's role in the world. Understanding this era involves tackling broader questions about liberalism, conservatism, the welfare state,
the cold war, globalization, the presidency, social movements, identity politics, popular culture, religion, and the media in modern U.S. history. This course will
address some of these questions, examine the varieties of ways in which individuals and social groups conceived and reconceived their personal and political
identities, and explore various methods used to assess contemporary history.

Arguably the single most powerful agency shaping life in the United States since the beginning of the twentieth century has been the automobile. Making cars
go--building and maintaining them and the systems they require--is by far the nation's largest industry. From cities and towns to the smallest hamlets and the
uninhabited wilderness beyond, the American landscape has been totally transformed by the automobile. In a hardly less important vein, automobiles have left an
indelible imprint on the dreams we dream. They have also changed forever where we live; the way we rear our children; how and what we consume; the demands
we make on government; the crimes we commit; the way we enforce the law--even the way we go to our graves. The course will consider this protein phenome-

American "medicine" underwent tremendous transition during the period we will study. Medical education, the medical profession, and notions about cures and
care changed fundamentally, as did ideas about the nature of illness itself. Our course of study, in addition to charting ways in which the practice of medicine in

HIST 375(S) History of American Childhood (Same as Africana Studies 375) (D)
Over the course of American history both the experience of childhood and our understandings of childhood have changed radically. Children have been bought
and sold as slaves, hanged as convicted witches, and purchased slaves themselves. A century ago many children were sent "out to work" at ages that our society
now defines as too young even to be left alone in the house. Common experiences of modern middle-class American childhood--summer camp, secondary
school, and organized youth sports teams--are recent additions to American life. Through reading works of history and autobiography we will explore American
childhood and what attitudes toward specific groups of children reveals about American society. This course is an EDI course; as such, we will consistently study
groups of children that differ by race and class. In addition, we will interrogate the category of childhood and debate its universality and usefulness. Does the
experience of childhood help to "unify" diverse groups of people?

sending countries and the historical ties of those countries to the United States, immigration and labor recruitment, anti-immigrant sentiments, and the develop-
ment of American immigration policy. This is an EDI course because it examines how people from different countries and cultures interacted with each other and

as well as more recent immigrants from Central and South American countries. Using the garment industry as an example of a labor intensive industry that has
gone global, we ask questions regarding the impact on Latinas in their countries of origin and in the United States. What impact has the global economy and
economic development had on Latinas' work and their households in their countries of origin? How have economic changes and government policies fostered
Latinas' migrations? How have Latinas been incorporated into the changing U.S. economy? How have Latinas confronted the challenges created by a globalizing
economy? We will also explore the migration and the experiences of Latina domestics and farm workers, past and present. Focusing on the experiences of Latinas
as they become racialized populations in the United States, this EDI course explores the impact of dominant U.S. hierarchies of race, gender and class on their
economic incorporation, as well as the myriad ways in which they confront, negotiate, and at times challenge those dominant U.S. hierarchies.

the struggle for civil rights, labor movements, and the social movements of the late 1960s and the 1970s. In addition to the unity these efforts represented as
Latinos and Latinas confronted the challenges presented by the larger society, we will also address the dynamics of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexuality

How did Germany, Italy, and Japan deal with the economic, political, and social crises of the 1930s? In what ways did each of these three countries navigate the
economic depression, challenges to democracy, and ascendance of totalitarianism that marked this pivotal and transformative decade? This course will take a
transnational approach to such questions, examining various aspects of the politics, economy, society, and culture of the 1930s in Germany, Italy, and Japan. It will
explore the origins and rise of Italian fascism, German National Socialism, and Japanese militarism; the political cultures of charisma, violence, terror, collabora-
tion, and resistance; racism and anti-Semitism; and fascist aesthetics. We will also consider how these phenomena shaped, and were shaped by, the nature of
everyday life in this decade with particular attention to issues of religion, family, and gender. To conclude the semester, we will discuss how the 1930s have been
remembered, and whether we can speak of fascisms at work in the present day. This course will fulfill the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative by
comparing how global frustrations and challenges played out both similarly and differently in Germany, Italy, and Japan; and how these countries that would

This course explores costume and fashion as vehicles for the (re)creation and expression of gender, class, and sexual identities in Europe and the United States.
We will begin by looking at the relationship between fashion and the political and economic power of the courts of early modern Europe. Revolutionary ideolo-
gies will be linked to sartorial politics, consumption of clothing to colonization, and changes in the style of clothing to shifting social norms. As our focus turns to
the fashion industry in the twentieth century, when mass-produced clothing increased the possibility for reflexivity and imaginative play in dress, we will relate
representations of the dressed body to the formation of diverse cultural communities, beauty ideals, and status hierarchies, examining both the normative and
subversive potential of fashion. The course considers work in the fields of art history, cultural history, sociology and anthropology, feminist theory, and fashion
journalism to ask questions such as: What are the origins of consumer societies? When, why, and how were fashion and consumption feminized? Is clothing a
language? What cultural, political and social meanings do certain forms of dress generate? What is the relationship between prevalent understandings of the body
168
and fashion? How is clothing used to stigmatize or differentiate individuals and communities? Topics include: the origins of uniforms and sportswear, eroticism
and androgyny in fashion, the cultural politics of ethnic" clothing, and the relationship between the fashion industry and cinema.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, an oral presentation, two short critical essays based on class readings, and a final research paper.

HIST 396(S) Muslims and Europe: From the Conquest of Algeria to the Present (D)
This course will explore Europe's tumultuous relationship with North Africa, focusing on French and British colonialism and its aftermath in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries. Topics to be covered include Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Anglo-French rivalry over the Canal and
the Suez crisis of 1956, the Algerian Revolution and the anti-Islamic coup in 1991-2, and the migration of North Africans and Indian/Pakistani Muslims to Europe
in the post 1945 period. Racial tensions, battles over headscarves, French hip-hop music, and Jewish-Muslim relations in contemporary France are among the
topics to be explored with an eye to examining how Europe is coming to terms with its new multicultural identity. By comparing and contrasting Muslim and
European societies, and by showing the ways in which colonial power and racial privilege affected these cultures, this course meets the EDI requirement as it
seeks to develop an empathetic understanding of the position of Muslims in Europe today.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, a few short papers, and a longer research paper.

ADVANCED SEMINARS: AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST (402-411)
HIST 408 Archaeology, Politics, and Heritage in the Middle East (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Archaeological sites and artifacts are not merely relics of the past; they can also be potent and conspicuous symbols of national identity for the modern nation-
state. In the Middle East, with its rich archaeological heritage, the relationship among politics, nationalism, and archeology has been particularly strong and
interesting. Nevertheless, this is a topic that has only recently attracted the attention of historians. In this seminar, we will analyze the experience of several Middle
Eastern countries, including Iraq, Israel, Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon, and Iran, and how they utilized archaeology for state-building purposes. We will discuss how
archaeology entered the political discourse, the creation of regional and national museums, the interpretation of archaeological artifacts in the arts and literature,
and archaeology's role in contested terrains and political disputes. We will also explore the function of archaeology in the region's important tourism industry.
Finally, the issue of cultural patrimony and the emotional impact of archaeology in the region will be addressed.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, oral presentations, short papers, and a major research paper.

ADVANCED SEMINARS: EUROPE AND RUSSIA (422-441)
HIST 425 The First Crusade (Same as Religion 215) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W) (D)
The First Crusade (1095-1131) was one of the most remarkable episodes in the history of the Middle Ages. Responding to the call of Pope Urban II, a mass
movement of armed pilgrims marched almost 2000 miles from western Europe to the Holy Land to reconquer Jerusalem from Turkish invaders. In the eyes of
these crusaders, they were undertaking a Christian pilgrimage and penitential war through which they hoped to win salvation, glory, and treasure. In the eyes of
others, however, the crusaders were savage barbarians who understood little of the sophisticated civilizations they encountered and who butchered innocent Jews,
Muslims, and fellow Christians in God's name. This seminar explores the origins, course, and impact of the First Crusade from social, cultural, theological,
political, economic, and military perspectives. Special attention will be given to analyzing, comparing, and contrasting different accounts of the First Crusade--
not only those of western Christians, but also of Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Muslims, and other witnesses. Through this study of the First Crusade, we will examine
one of the defining events of the Middle Ages and uncover the roots of much ethnic, religious, and political conflict in our modern world.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on several short papers, a map quiz, a research paper, and class participation.

HIST 430(F) Toward a History of the Self in Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century Europe
The self may appear to us as a fixed and stable entity that all people have in common throughout time. However this course puts forward a different view,
suggesting that the self is context-specific and subject to the culture and society of particular places and historical eras. Using a range of sources that include
historical writing, social theory, psychological theory, literary scholarship, diaries, memoirs, film, and art, we will examine changing, coexisting, and sometimes
conflicting notions of selfhood in Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. From the "individualism" seemingly legitimated by the French Revolution to
modern and postmodern conceptions of the fragmented or decentered self, different narratives of the self have been elaborated during the prior two centuries
which continue to influence how we think about identity and subjectivity. The goal of this course is to enable students to think historically about the concepts of
self, person, or individual and to explore a range of intellectual approaches to analyzing the nature of the self. Seminar meetings will be devoted to the discussion
of common readings. Students should develop research topics in consultation with the instructor.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly response papers (2 pages), an oral presentation, and a final research paper (12-15 pages).

HIST 432 Experiencing the Great War (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
In Europe the First World War (not the Second, as Americans might expect) is still remembered as the "Great War." The First World War shattered a long century
of near-total peace on the continent, profoundly changed social and political relations in all combatant countries, and shifted the balance of global power toward
the emerging United States. In retrospect, the war opened the floodgates of modern history, creating space for decolonization, communism, fascism, welfare-state
liberalism, suffrage movements, and the final demise of continental monarchies. This seminar will explore the ways that individuals and groups in the belligerent
nations experienced the war asking, in the process, whose experiences "count" in the historiography of the war and looking at the ways in which historians access
the varieties of social experience. Students should take from this course a basic factual knowledge of the origins, trajectory, and afterlives of the First World War, a
sense of how the experience of the war differed by national and social identity, an idea of the debates that animate the historical discussions of the war, and an
ability to work with sources in order to engage with those debates.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, two short papers or bibliographic assignments, and a research paper of approximately 25 pages.
Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10-15). Preference given to junior and senior History majors with some familiarity with modern European history.

HIST 439 Personality, Society, and Identity in Nineteenth- and Early Twentieth-Century Russian Thought (Not offered 2009-2010; to be
offered 2010-2011)
This seminar studies the movements and themes of Russian thought from the Enlightenment to 1917, situating works of Russian philosophy and literature, when
appropriate, within the broader context of Western intellectual traditions. We will explore how ideas about human nature and society inspired and gave meaning to
political reform, terrorism, and revolution in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and ponder their relevance in Russia today. The course covers themes
such as the individual and society, morality and love, and time and eschatology, as well as topics like: the problem of national identity, conservatism and radical-
ism, the forging of the intelligentsia" tradition, the commercialization of culture, and revolutionary language in 1917. Readings include texts by Pushkin, Belin-
sky, Dostoevsky, Herzen, Tolstoy, Solvyov, Berdiaev, as well as modernist works (Bely, Blok, Ivanov) and Marxist writings (Plekhanov, Bogdanov, Lenin). We
also will read secondary historical literature, watch films, and listen to music in order to gain a deeper understanding of the cultural environment in which our
primary sources were written and the ways social ideals and types were disseminated.
Format: seminar. Knowledge of Russian is NOT a prerequisite for this course. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several oral presentations and short
preliminary writing assignments, and a final research paper.

HIST 443 Slavery, Race and Ethnicity in Latin America (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (D)
At times in this century African Americans have looked to Brazil and other Latin-American countries as a sort of racial paradise, where people of color did not
suffer the same brutal prejudice and violence that they faced in the U.S. Especially since the 1930s, on the other hand, some Latin Americans of African descent
have admired the force, consciousness, and independence of Black movements in the U.S., wishing they could construct similar organizations in their own
countries. Although they might at first seem contradictory, these attitudes are rather reflections of the complex and subtle differences in the systems of race
relations that have developed historically in the Americas. Instead of wondering which group of observers was more correct in its analysis of the other's country,
we will in this seminar try to see how each group was both right and wrong in its judgment and how the history of their home society shaped their attitudes toward
other countries. To do this, we will explore the historical roots of race relations and politics in Latin America from the beginnings of slavery through its abolition;
the changing constructions of indigenous ethnicities; and on to the emergence of new Black Movements and other race-based political currents in Colombia,
Brazil, and throughout the region.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, weekly reading responses, and a final paper.

HIST 452 Women in America, 1603-1865 (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 452) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Women have always been mothers, wives and daughters; and through much of their history in North America, their relationship to the state has been mediated
through men. Their labor, be it in the household, as free wage laborers, farm hands, or slaves, was important both to the development of the American market
economy and to the ideology and rhetoric of nationhood. This seminar will explore the significance of the experiences of American women from the colonial era
through the Civil War. We will address the impact of slavery on all American women, the role of women during the nineteenth-century period of intense urbaniza-
tion and industrialization, and the ways in which literacy and artistic culture shaped the way American women portrayed their own lives. Throughout the semester
we will read primary documents, both as a class and individually. One goal for students is the ability to read sources critically and to evaluate the role of literacy
and writing itself in women's history. Our inquiry will encompass women in New England, the South and the Hispanic Southwest. As we study works of history,
we will also read twentieth-century feminist and race theory to understand the connections between practice and theory, between narrative and argument.
Format: seminar. Requirements include a research paper (20-25 pages), based on reading and analysis of a set of primary sources, a literature review, class partici-
pation, and an informal reading journal.

the war years, we shall study both the war itself and homefront conditions: military, naval, political, economic, and especially social aspects will be examined in
some detail. Our study of Reconstruction will concentrate on the evolution of federal policy toward the Southern states and the workings out of that policy in the

HIST 457(S) Gender, Law, and Politics in U.S. History (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 457)
This seminar explores the legal history of the United States as a gendered system. It examines how women have shaped the meanings of American citizenship
through pursuit of political rights and obligations such as suffrage, jury duty, and military service; how those political struggles have varied across race, religion,
and class; and how the legal system has shaped gender relations for both women and men through regulation of such issues as marriage, divorce, work, reproduc-
tion, and the family. While we will read some court cases, the focus of the seminar is on the broader relationship between law and society. Readings will address
not only the history of statutory law, and of the lawsuits and trials testing those laws, but also the social history of the impact of the law and the political history of
efforts to change laws.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on an extensive (20-25 page) research paper that makes use of primary and secondary sources, brief papers on the

HIST 459 Jim Crow (Same as Africana Studies 459) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (D)
Between 1865 and 1965 white Americans developed and deployed a set of practices that sanctioned racial discrimination. Jim Crow--as this American system of
apartheid was called-- is one of the least studied aspects of U. S. History. This course explores the law, cultural, economics, and politics of Jim Crow; the
dynamics of racialized power; and the roles of media and history in sustaining racial inequality. Informed by how segregation operated to construct and sustain
differences, it qualifies as an Exploring Diversity Initiative course by linking the issue of diversity to the issue of power relations, investigating how American
institutions enabled and maintained racial disparities despite constitutional guarantees, and considering how the legacy of racial discrimination affects current
domestic issues like public education, affirmative action, and the persistence of poverty. In addition to covering race theory in historical context, the course
suggests that current scientific ideas about race--that there are no consequential biological differences among humans--is a recent discovery. Finally, the course
examines the discrete development of black communities, institutions, politics, and racial destiny.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation and two shorter assignments leading up to a longer research paper.

The election of Barack H. Obama would not have been possible without the achievements of the Great Society--specifically, the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, 1965,
and 1968 plus the Immigration Reform Act of 1965. Other landmark legislation in education, environmentalism, poverty, public communications, health care,
transportation, the arts, and humanities established the basic contours of today's society. In foreign affairs, the Johnson years are burdened with Vietnam, but that
debacle was counterbalanced in part by achievements in the Middle East, Central America and Europe. This course will explore the causes and consequences of
one of the twentieth century's great reform movements and examine the bases of the Johnson administration's foreign policies.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on two comparative book reviews, oral and written, and a twenty page research paper.

U.S. involvement in Vietnam affected nearly every aspect of American life, including the country's overall foreign policy, its military strategy, the relationship
between various branches of government, the nation's political trajectory, the role of media in society, youth culture, race relations, and more. This seminar
explores America's war in Vietnam and its dramatic ramifications at home and abroad. We will evaluate the Vietnam War era as a turning point in U.S. histo-
ry--and in the role of the U.S. in the world--by reading and discussing a number of scholarly works on domestic and international aspects of the conflict.

HIST 466(S) Imagining Urban America, Three Case Studies: Boston, Chicago, and L.A. (Same as American Studies 364)
This course will explore the social, economic, and cultural lives of three cities, each of which at its zenith seemed to contemporaries to represent definitive aspects
of "American" development. We will begin with Boston--the country's first "big" city and the nominal capital of Puritan New England--in the colonial and
170
early national periods. From there we will move to Chicago, the transportation and commercial hub of the emerging national economy in the nineteenth century.
Finally we will turn to Los Angeles, "The City of Dreams" and the center of the popular entertainment industry in the twentieth century. In each case, drawing on
a variety of sources, we will examine the city's origins, the factors that promoted its growth, and the distinctive society it engendered. Then we will consider some
of the city's cultural expressions--expressions that seem to characterize not only changing the nature of urban life, but the particular meanings each city gave to
the nation's experience at the time. What made these cities seem simultaneously, as they did, so alluring and so threatening to the fabric of national community
and identity?

The United States is a country born of revolution and steeped in anti-colonialism. Nevertheless, by the second half of the twentieth century, the U.S. government
found itself allied with European imperial powers and battling emerging revolutionary movements around the developing world. This course will examine this
transition and consider the nature and longterm implications of the U.S. response to revolution in the postcolonial world. We will look at a number of revolution-
ary movements in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa with a focus on the 1960s and 1970s. Case studies will include the Cuban, Vietnamese,
Palestinian, Angolan, and Iranian Revolutions. Students will write an original 2025 page research paper, based on primary sources, on a topic to be chosen in

HIST 475 Modern Warfare and Military Leadership (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Since the late-eighteenth century, the history of the West has been marked by a number of enormously destructive and decisive wars fought by nation-states on a
continental and global scale. This era witnessed dramatic changes in the size, armaments, organization, and lethal nature of military forces at sea, on land, and,
more recently, in the air, culminating in highly mechanized warfare, and its ultimate weapon, the atomic bomb. This course will study that warfare, paying special
attention to the role military leadership played in its development. We will concentrate our attention on the Napoleonic Wars, the American Civil War, World War
I, and World War II, and such leaders as Napoleon, Lee and Grant, Haig and Ludendorff, Churchill, Hitler, Stalin, Marshall, Eisenhower, and MacArthur. Do
these great leaders provide the key to our understanding of modern warfare? Or are certain "timeless" principles, factors, and behaviors that consistently transcend
local historical contexts more important?
Format: seminar. Requirements: a substantial (no upper limit on length) research paper on a topic of the student's choice growing out of some aspect of the course.
Participants will, in teams of two or three, lead class discussion at least once as well as give class reports on the course readings. There will be several required

"The end is near!" Millions of people around the world believe that the course of history and the sequence of events that will herald the end of the world are
foretold in their scripture, whether Judaic, Christian, or Islamic. These beliefs can have, and have had, widespread social ramifications. This seminar will explore
various important political and religious movements that have responded to an apocalyptic message by calling for drastic societal change. Both the social critique
of these movements and why they felt that the end was imminent will be analyzed. Special attention will be paid to millenarian movements in the Middle East,
North America, and Asia. Students will also assess apocalyptic themes in music, literature and the visual arts.

HIST 481T The American Revolution, 1763-1798: Meanings and Interpretations (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
During the second half of the eighteenth century, the political, social, and demographic landscape of eastern North America underwent dramatic transformations.
If many of the characters and events marking the transition of the region from a cluster of thirteen colonies to the first republic of the western hemisphere are quite
familiar to most Americans, the movement to independence and the creation of the United States have been the subject of complex and sometimes contentious
historical interpretations. This tutorial will explore the ideological, economic, political, and cultural causes and consequences of the American Revolution, from
the emergence of increasing tensions between Great Britain and its North American colonies to the attempts of the United States government to limit political
expression and immigration in the new nation. Through the close reading of some of the most significant scholarship of the period, we will seek to understand
how a multitude of historical actors of varied social, economic, religious, and ethnic backgrounds made and shaped the famous political, military, and constitu-
tional struggles of the Revolutionary Era. By the end of this tutorial, students will have engaged and debated some of the most important historiographical assess-
ments of the Revolutionary Era. In their final assignment, students will be equipped to provide an erudite and personal answer to the most important question of
all: How revolutionary was the Revolution?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: once a week for about an hour, student will meet with the instructor in pairs. During our sessions, students will alternatively
present orally or critique a written essay of seven double-spaced pages on a topic assigned by the instructor. At the end of the semester, students will be asked to

HIST 482T(S) Fictions of African-American History (Same as Africana Studies 482) (W)
This course examines the form and function of African-American historical narratives with attention to written texts pertaining to the enslavement and freedom of
African Americans during the nineteenth and early twentieth century. The lack of documentary material pertaining to this history has made the task of reading and
interpreting African American experience particularly challenging. By crossing generic and disciplinary boundaries, students will take up the task of reading
African-American history while attending to the difficulties such a task raises. To do so, we will read both historical and fictional narratives that raise explicitly the
problems of writing African-American history.
In the first part of the course, we will discuss selected texts (fiction, narrative, and historiography) from the antebellum era in order to schematize the literature of
slavery. In the second half of the course, we will take up the discourse of freedom that followed the Emancipation Proclamation. Readings will include works by
171
Booker T. Washington, James Weldon Johnson, Charles Chesnutt, Harriet Wilson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Sutton Griggs. In addition, we will read historiography
on African American slavery, freedom, and urbanization.

HIST 483T African Political Thought (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
This course examines the ideas of major figures in the progressive tradition of African political thought. This emancipatory tradition emerged in societies shaped
by racial, cultural, and economic exploitation, forcing both African men and women to address questions of identity and political action. Most members of this
tradition also considered the ways in which uneven power relations within African communities shaped the personal and political landscapes. The Africans we
will examine in this course drew on resources as varied as Pan-Africanism, Nationalism, Classical Liberalism, Social Democracy, Marxism, Black Conscious-
ness, Negritude and Gender theory, yet each participated, at least implicitly, in a common African intellectual project: the meaning of Africa and of being African.

HIST 485T(F) Stalinist Terror and the New Man (W)
The Bolsheviks strove to engineer a new type of person--socially active, cultivated, healthy, enthusiastic, and ready to build socialism. The methods used and the
results produced in the name of this goal included acts of monumental heroism and violence, narratives of human progress, and chronicles of arguably the most
egregious human rights violations of the 20th century. In this course we will look at the ways historians, memoirists, and filmmakers have approached the period
known as Stalin's Great Purge and Terror (1936-1939), attempting to answer questions to do with culpability, meaning, commitment, belief and disguise, fear, and
betrayal. Dualistic concepts and categories like state/society, resistance/collusion, and domination/submission have engendered much controversy among schol-
ars applying them to a time when victims and perpetrators were difficult to distinguish and often the same individuals. The course charts historical analyses and
disputes around topics such as: the crimes of communism,"revolution from above," Stalin's personality, popular participation in show trials, the family and every-
day life during the Terror, Stalinist science, and Soviet subjectivity.

HIST 486T(F) Historical Memory of the Pacific War (Same as Asian Studies 486T and Japanese 486T) (W)
Over six decades after Japan's surrender, the issue of how to remember the Pacific War continues to raise controversy both within Japan and between Japan,
Korea, and China. This tutorial will consider how individuals, groups of individuals, and nations construct and reconstruct historical memories by examining how
various Japanese, as well as Koreans and Chinese, have sought to remember the Pacific War. The course will begin with a discussion of theoretical writings on the
social and political construction of historical memory and the distinctions between official, collective, and historical memory. Then we will consider Japan's
unique position as both wartime aggressor and victim, focusing on how the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Occupation, and the Tokyo war
crimes trial have shaped how the war has been remembered. We will also deal with how the war has been portrayed in literature, film, and other media. Finally, the
course will explore how Japanese, Korean, and Chinese memories of the war continue to influence relationships within East Asia. We will examine the mnemon-
ic sites contested by Chinese, Korean, and Japanese memories by discussing issues pertaining to military comfort women, the Nanking massacre, Unit 731,
history textbooks, and Yasukuni shrine. Themes will include how the construction of memory is linked to the nation, how the passage of time influences the
construction of historical memory, and the dilemmas of coming to terms with pasts contested both within and between countries.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Each student will write and present orally a 5- to 7-page
essay every other week on the readings assigned for that week. In alternate weeks, students will be responsible for offering an oral critique of the work of their
partner. Students will be evaluated on their written work and their analyses of their partner's work. There will a final paper (15 pages) on the themes of the course.

HIST 487T The Second World War: Origins, Course, Outcomes, and Meaning (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
1991 marked the fiftieth anniversaries of the Nazi invasion of Russia and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Though war had come to Europe as early as 1939,
when Germany invaded Poland, after 1941 the war became a truly global conflict of unprecedented extent, ferocity, and destructiveness. As late as 1943 it still
appeared that the Axis powers might win the war. But, by the end of the 1945, the bombed-out ruins of Germany and Japan were occupied by the Allies, who
were preparing to put the surviving Axis leaders and generals on trial for war crimes.
This tutorial will concentrate on a number of important questions and issues which arise from a study of World War II. What were the origins of this central event
of the twentieth century? How and why did the war begin? Why did the war take the course it did? What were the most crucial or decisive episodes or events?
How did the Allies win? Why did the Axis lose? Could the outcome have been different?
Many of the topics examined will also have to deal with important questions of human responsibility and with the moral or ethical dimensions of the war. Why did
France, Britain, and the Soviet Union not stop Hitler earlier? Who was to blame for the fall of France and the Pearl Harbor fiasco? Why did the Allies adopt a
policy of extensive firebombing of civilian targets? How could the Holocaust have happened? Could it have been stopped? Did the Atomic bomb have to be
dropped? Were the war crime trials justified?
By the end of the tutorial, students will have become thoroughly familiar with the general course the war followed as well as acquiring in-depth knowledge of the
most decisive and important aspects of the conflict. Students will also have grappled with the task of systematically assessing what combinations of material and
human factors can best explain the outcomes of the major turning points of the war. Students will also have dealt with the problem of assessing the moral and
ethical responsibility of those persons, organizations, and institutions involved in the war.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: each student will write and present orally an essay of approximately seven double-spaced pages every other week on a topic
assigned by the instructor. Students not presenting an essay have the responsibility of critiquing the work of their colleague. The tutorial will culminate in a final
written exercise.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Open to all.

HIST 489T(S) Western Political Thought in Transition (Same as Political Science 359T) (W)
While modern Western political thought traces its roots to the classical era of the Greek polis, its direct legacy from the Greeks derived in fact from the later
(Hellenistic) period. It was monarchical in nature and was destined to be creatively transformed during the turbulent centuries stretching from late antiquity to the
eighteenth. This tutorial will focus on that crucial period of transition, which eventuated in the emergence of recognizably "modern" constitutionalist notions of
consent, parliamentary representation, and individual rights. Readings will involve both primary texts and secondary sources and will concentrate on the con-
tributions of such authors as Eusebius of Caesarea, Augustine, Aquinas, Dante, John of Paris, Marsiglio of Padua, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
Format: tutorial. Each student will write and present orally every other week an essay of approximately 7 pages on an assigned topic focusing on the readings for
that week. Students not presenting an essay in a given week will be responsible for presenting orally a 2 page written critique of their tutorial partner's essay.
Students will be evaluated on their essays, their critiques, and on a brief final written exercise focusing on the overall themes of the tutorial.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to History and Political Science majors.

HIST 490T(S) Memory, History, and the Extermination of the Jews of Europe (Same as Jewish Studies 490T) (W)
The atrocities committed by Nazi Germany during the Second World War continue to trouble historians in their attempts to understand and represent them in all
their magnitude and horror. Beyond historians, the complicity of segments of European societies in perpetrating those atrocities continues to raise thorny ques-
tions for postwar European nations about what their responsibilities are toward that past. This tutorial will focus on a series of questions relating to the historiciza-
tion and memorialization of the extermination of European Jews. They include: Is the Holocaust unique? Is it a Jewish story or universal story? Does the Holo-
caust raise different issues for the historian than other historical events? How should the Holocaust be represented and what are the implications of different means
of representing it? What role, if any, did European Jews play in their own destruction? Has Germany faced up to its past? Were Germans also victims of World
War II? Who were the "bystanders" as compared to the "perpetrators"? Were the postwar trials of perpetrators a travesty of justice? How appropriate are the
different uses that Israel and the United States have made of the Holocaust? By the end of the course, students will have grappled with the ongoing controversies
172
that have arisen among scholars, governments, and lay people about the meaning (and meaninglessness) of the Holocaust for the postwar world. In a world in
which extraordinary acts of violence continue to be perpetrated and more and more nations' pasts are marked by episodes of extreme criminality and/or trauma,
exploring the manner by which one such episode has been remembered, avenged, and adjudicated should prove relevant for future consideration of other soci-
eties' efforts to confront their own traumatic pasts.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Class time consists of weekly one-hour sessions with the instructor and a fellow student. Every other week the student will write
and present orally a 5- to 7-page paper on the assigned readings of that week. On alternate weeks, the student will write a 2-page critique of the fellow student's
paper. A final written exercise, a thought piece on the issues raised in the tutorial, will cap off the semester's work.
Prerequisite: permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference give to History majors and Jewish Studies concentrators.

HIST 491T Political Islam: Past, Present, Future (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (D) (W)
Why have Islamist movements become so powerful in the last 30 years? What are their real political goals? Is political Islam a rejection of modernity, a reaction to
Western culture, or an ideology aimed at specific political objectives? Does the rise of political Islam herald an inevitable "clash of civilizations" with the West, or
can Islam and the West peacefully co-exist? Questions such as these have become increasingly urgent since September 11. This course will examine the emer-
gence, development, and substantive content of Islamist political movements in the twentieth century. The tutorial focuses upon the emergence of Islamist move-
ments within distinctive political, economic, social and cultural conditions in the Middle East. It will juxtapose analytical readings on specific states or aspects of
the Islamic trend with the writings of Islamists and other primary sources. We will look both at Islamist movements active in single states, the wider phenomenon
of transnational Islamist politics, and the theoretical and philosophical issues raised by the rise of Islamist movements, to consider both similarities and diversity in
Islamic politics. The object of the course is to understand Islamist movements on their own terms, and to be able to make informed judgments about the future of
international politics. Because of its comparative approach and its concerns with power and privilege this course is part of the Exploring Diversity Initiative.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: 5- to 7-page essays or 2-page critiques due each week and a final report (3-4 pages) at the end of the semester.
Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to History majors and to those who have taken History 207 or other courses on the Middle East.

HIST 492T Revolutionary Thought in Latin America (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (D) (W)
Throughout Latin America revolution has been a focus of political and social thought --as well as political organizing and armed initiatives --since the late
eighteenth century and continues to be so, albeit in changed form, today. This course will examine the trajectory of various types of revolutionary theory in Latin
America, from the anti-colonial and anti--white thought behind massive Andean uprisings in the 1780s to efforts to win national sovereignty and to construct
socialist or other revolutionary states in modern Mexico, Guatemala, Cuba, and Nicaragua, and, more recently, to put more racially-, ethnically-, and gender-ori-
ented notions of social justice into place. We will work to measure the impact of revolutionary thought as well as to tease out the internal tensions in the utopian
ideals that revolutionaries have implicitly or explicitly pursued. We will also weigh the impact of more strictly intellectual currents and of geopolitical concerns on
the evolution of Latin American ideas of revolution. This course will fulfill the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative by comparing and analyzing
divergent theorizations of history and society, as well as the contexts in which such theories emerged and to which we might or might not choose to apply them. A
central aim of the course will be to compare the formation of revolutionary initiatives across national and chronological boundaries.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet with the instructor in pairs for an hour each week. Each student will write and present a 5- to 7- page essay
every other week on the readings assigned for that week. In alternate weeks, students will be responsible for offering an oral critique of the work of their partner.
Evaluation will be based on written work and analysis of their partner's work.

THE THESIS AND INDEPENDENT STUDY (493-499)
HIST 493(F) Senior Honors Thesis--Research Seminar
This seminar is a colloquium for the writers of honors theses. Although each student's major work for the fall will be the writing of a thesis in consultation with an
individual advisor, students will gather for occasional meetings in order to present and critique each other's proposals and drafts and to discuss common problems
in research and the design of a long analytical essay. Evaluation will be based on class participation and completed written work, and will determine if a student
will continue in the thesis program. For students proceeding to W31 and HIST 494, performance in fall semester will figure into the thesis grade calculated at the
end of the year. The quality of a student's performance in the colloquium segment of History 493, as well as his or her performance in all aspects of the May
colloquium at which theses are presented and critiqued, will be figured into the overall grade the student is given for History 493-494 and the departmental
decision to award Honors or Highest Honors at Commencement.

HISTORY OF SCIENCE
(Div. II & III, see course descriptions)
Chair, Professor DONALD deB. BEAVER
A major in the History of Science is not offered, but the occasional Contract Major in it or a related interdisciplinary field is possible. Courses in the History of
Science are designed primarily to complement and strengthen work in other major fields. Although any of the courses may be taken separately, studying related
courses in other departments will enhance their value, because by nature, History of Science is interdisciplinary.
The following will serve as examples: the 101 course is an introduction to science and technology studies, and concentrates on key aspects of contemporary
science and technology relevant to many issues of living in a technological society. Scientific Revolutions (HSCI 224) deals with the emergence of modern
science in the 1600s and 1700s, and with subsequent revolutions in scientific thought; as such it complements courses related to modern European history. History
of Science 240 traces the influential role of science and invention in the shaping of American culture, and complements offerings in American Studies and
American History. HSCI 320, an historical overview of the ideas, practice, and organization of medicine, provides context for related coursework in History,
Philosophy, and the Premed Program.
HSCI 101(S) Science, Technology, and Human Values (Same as Science and Technology Studies 101)
A study of the natures and roles of science and technology in today's society, and of the problems which technical advances pose for human values. An introduc-
tion to science-technology studies. Topics include: scientific creativity, the Two Cultures, the norms and values of science, the Manhattan Project and Big Science,
the ethics and social responsibility of science, appropriate technology, technology assessment, and various problems which spring from dependencies engendered
by living in a technological society, e.g., computers and privacy, automation and dehumanization, biomedical engineering.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two or three short exercises, two papers (3-5 pages and 5-7 pages), and two hour exams.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Satisfies one semester of the Division II requirement.

HSCI 224 Scientific Revolutions: 1543-1927 (Same as History 294) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
How much does science create the sensibilities and values of the modern world? How much, if any, technical detail is it necessary to know in order to understand
the difference between propaganda and fact?
This course investigates four major changes of world view, associated with Copernicus (1543); Newton (1687); Darwin (1859); and Planck (1900) and Einstein
(1905). It also treats briefly the emergence of modern cosmogony, geology, and chemistry as additional reorganizations of belief about our origins, our past, and
our material structure.
We first acquire a basic familiarity with the scientific use and meaning of the new paradigms, as they emerged in historical context. We then ask how those ideas
fit together to form a new framework, and ask what their trans-scientific legacy has been, that is, how they have affected ideas and values in other sciences, other
fields or thought, and in society. Knowledge of high-school algebra is presupposed.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on five problem sets, four short papers (3-5 pages), and two hour exams.
Enrollment limit: 30. Open to first-year students.
Satisfies one semester of the Division III requirement.

HSCI 240(F) Technology and Science in American Culture (Same as History 295)
Although technologically dependent, the American colonies slowly built a network of native scientists and inventors whose skills helped shape the United States'
response to the Industrial Revolution. The interaction of science, technology, and society in the nineteenth century did much to form American identity: the
machine in the garden, through the "American System of Manufactures" helped America rise to technological prominence; the professionalization and special-
ization of science and engineering led to their becoming vital national resources. Understanding these developments, as well as the heroic age of American
invention (1865-1914), forms the focus of this course: how science and technology have helped shape modern American life.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class discussion, six short reports (2-3 pages), and two hour exams.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Open to first-year students.

HSCI 320(S) History of Medicine (Same as History 293)
A study of the growth and development of medical thought and practice, together with consideration of its interaction with science and social forces and institu-
tions. The course aims at an appreciation of the socio-historical construction of Western medicine, from prehistory to the twentieth century. The course begins
with paleomedical reconstructions, and moves to Babylonian, Egyptian and Greek [not only Hippocratic] medicine, Greek and Roman anatomy and physiology,
Arabic medical thought, Renaissance medicine, and the gradual professionalization and specialization of medicine from the sixteenth century. Attention is paid to
theories of health and disease, ideas about anatomy and physiology, in addition to achievements such as anesthesia and internal surgery, and advances in instru-
ments such as obstetrical forceps and the stethoscope.
Format: seminar. Requirements: six short papers (3 pages), midterm, final hour exam.

INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES
(Div. II, with some exceptions as noted in course descriptions)
Chair, Professor PETER JUST
Advisory Committee: Professors: DARROW, JUST, ZIMMERBERG**. Associate Professor: CRUZ. Assistant Professor: HAMMERSCHLAG.
This program is designed to facilitate and promote innovations in curricular offerings in relation both to interdisciplinary conceptual focus and experimental
pedagogical form. It provides support for faculty and student efforts to develop a curriculum that creatively responds to intellectual needs and modes of teaching/
learning that currently fall outside the conventional pattern.
EXPR 245 (Re)presenting Sex: Shakespeare on Page and Stage (Same as Theatre 245 and Women's anf Gender Studies 245) (Not offered
2009-2010)
This experimental course approaches the question of how sex and sexual identity are portrayed in Shakespeare from two different directions-close reading fo-
cused on the page and acting centered on the stage. These two critical modes-reading the text versus performing the script-are often treated in compartmentalized
fashion as separate, even incompatible activities. Our goal is to take up the challenge of bringing the two perspectives together within the framework of a single,
integrated course. The teaching method is to bridge the gap between the two modes not by magically dissolving, but by actively engaging, the tensions between
them. For example, no performance can include all the possible interpretations; performance decisions raise questions about what alternatives have been left out.
Similarly, when all interpretive possibilities are held in imaginative suspension, the specifics of bodily movement and face-to-face interaction whose meanings
emerge when enacted are lost.
We propose to put the two orientations in a productive and innovative dialogue that enables students to experience the tension from both sides, to articulate the
opportunities and limits of each side, and to combine their respective strengths.
The mix of assignments (papers and scene work) will vary depending on whether students designate themselves as primarily "scholars" or "actors," but some
overlap will be built in to ensure that "scholars" gain understanding of acting and "actors" gain access to scholarship. All students will be expected to demonstrate
versatility in traversing the full spectrum from interpretation through reading to interpretation through performance.
The specific topic that will bring these theoretical issues into focus is the matter of sex and sexual identity, as illuminated through the analysis of language,
psychology, and theatrical embodiment. Six plays will be studied in depth: The Merchant of Venice, Twelfth Night, Othello, King Lear, Antony and Cleopatra, and
The Winter's Tale.
Format: lecture/discussion,with additional periods set aside for scene presentation. Evaluation will be based on several short papers, plus a final exam. All stu-
dents will take the final: "scholar" students will have rigorous expectations in the writing of papers; "actor" students will have intensive (graded) performance
expectations.
No prerequisites; students wishing to enroll as Acting Students should consult with instructors. Enrollment limit: 15-20 (expected: 15).

EXPR 309(F) Exploring Creativity (Same as ArtS 309, English 309, Mathematics 309 and Philosophy 307)
This course centers on the creative process involved in generating original ideas, theories, and artistic works. Here, in three-week blocks, we will explore inten-
sively the creativity involved in studio art, philosophy, creative writing/poetry, and mathematics by attempting to produce original works in each of these areas of
study. Our focus will be more on the creative process rather than the final products. Students will be encouraged to take risks, experiment, push their imaginations
beyond their limits, and explore consequences of failed attempts. Questions with which we will struggle include: What constitutes art, poetry, philosophy, and
mathematics? How can we judge the quality and aesthetics within these areas? What are the similarities and differences in the act of creating within these seem-
ingly disparate contexts? How can we become more creative by intent?
Format: Primarily student led discussions and hands-on "studio" work. Evaluation will be based on presentations, participation, short papers, and projects.
Prerequisites: permission of the instructor. As this course is designed to be an exploration into unfamiliar intellectual worlds, students with expertise in one or
perhaps two of the areas (art, creative writing, philosophy, and mathematics) are especially encouraged to participate. Enrollment limit: 12 (expected: 12). Prefer-
ence will be given to juniors and senior majors of at least one of these areas.
Satisfies one semester of the Division I, II or III requirement. Each student may choose the division for which he or she wishes credit.

INTR 150(S) Dimensions of Public Health
Public health is concerned with protecting and improving health at the level of a community or population. Although individual behavior is an essential element
of public health, collective, rather than individual, outcomes are the focus of public health study. The field of public health relies on contributions from multiple
disciplines, including economics, philosophy, biology, sociology and political science, among others. In this course we will survey the field of public health,
introducing students to core concepts and methods that highlight the interrelationship of individual and social choice with environmental and biological factors in
producing health outcomes at the population level. We will develop these concepts and methods within the context of signal cases and public health crises, both
historical and contemporary, including, for example, London's Broad Street cholera epidemic, tuberculosis control/eradication efforts, HIV/AIDS, lead poison-
ing, and obesity. Throughout our study of these cases, we will focus on key questions at the heart of public health. For example, what is effective public health
policy and how can we measure its effectiveness? How do we reconcile competing moral and economic claims in shaping such policy? How do our fundamental
beliefs and understanding of mortality determine our approach to public health decisions? How are these decisions made?
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon five mid-length papers (5-7 pages each) and the quality of contributions to class discussion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.

Advisory Committee: Professors: CAPRIO, CASSIDAY, CRANE, DARROW, D. GOLLIN, KUBLER, MAHON, MUTONGI, A. V. SWAMY. As-
sociate Professors: BANTA, BERNHARDSSON.
In this era of cultural, technological and economic globalization and also of pressing international crises including environmental degradation, poverty and
underdevelopment, terrorism and pandemics, knowledge of the world beyond the United States is an essential part of the liberal education that is the goal of the
Williams experience. Both within and outside the classroom the College provides a rich array of opportunities to pursue that goal. The International Studies
Program is designed to increase awareness of those opportunities and to provide a centralizing mechanism to encourage gaining such knowledge with perspec-
tives that are cross disciplinary and comparative.
The program administers a number of tracks that provide students with the opportunity to pursue study of one area of the world or theme as a way of comple-
menting the work they have done in their majors. Students will be expected to take courses in at least two departments to fulfill the requirements of a track. In
addition to completing International Studies 101, they will be expected to do five courses in a track including an approved senior exercise. Students may not count
a course toward more than one track in the program. They may pursue two tracks but will need to meet the course requirements for each track with a full comple-
ment of courses.

Tracks are of two kinds. The first type focuses either on a particular region of the world or a contact zone where several cultural traditions encounter each other.
The second type is organized thematically and will explore a cultural, political, economic or technological issue globally. Each track will be administered by
faculty teaching in that track in consultation with the steering committee. Each track may set an additional requirement of a level of language competency for its
concentrators. Each track may also require one of the elective courses to be comparative, i.e. course that might not cover material directly dealing with their area,
but would enrich the student's experience with tools for comparative inquiry. At present the program consists of the following tracks:
Area Tracks Thematic Tracks
African Studies Borders, Exile and Diaspora Studies
East Asian Studies Economic Development Studies
Latin American Studies Global Health
Middle Eastern Studies Urbanizing World
Russian and Eurasian Studies
South and Southeast Asia Studies
To complete a track, students must take a section of International Studies 101, complete five additional approved courses within the track, attend the weekly
International Studies colloquium and complete a senior exercise. Credit for work done on study abroad will likely provide one or more of the electives for many
concentrators.
International Studies 101
All students wishing to pursue the program should take a section of International Studies 101 early in their careers. These courses will usually be team taught.
The topics and regions covered will vary and be selective, but all will be designed to place cultural, political, economic and technological issues in conversation
with one another to illustrate the necessity of having a broad range of disciplinary tools available to pursue an individual track. On occasion students may
petition to substitute a course equivalent in scope to International Studies 101 to meet this requirement.
Study Abroad and Internships
Study abroad and/or overseas internships are an essential component of International Studies. The program in coordination with the Study Abroad Advisor and
the Office of Career Counseling will advise students on opportunities in these areas. One or more courses completed on an approved study abroad program can be
counted toward the five elective courses requirement.
Colloquium
Concentrators will be expected to attend fifteen sessions of the International Studies colloquia in their senior year, and are urged to do so throughout their
careers at Williams. We hope that it will become a regular event for all concentrators. The colloquium meets weekly at the Center for Foreign Languages and
Cultures and is designed to feature faculty, students, CDE fellows and outside speakers addressing issues of wide interest to those in International Studies.
Senior Exercise
All concentrators must also complete a senior exercise. This will be a substantial piece of writing (20-25 pages) that would allow a student to draw together
both their disciplinary skills and expertise in a particular area. It might be work done either in the context of a senior capstone course in a relevant department or in
the context of a shared seminar sponsored by the International Studies program. In both cases it would culminate in a public presentation by each concentrator of
his/her work in class or in the context of the International Studies Colloquium.
Honors
A candidate for honors in International Studies must maintain at least a B+ average in the concentration and be admitted to candidacy by the program faculty.
An honors candidate must complete her/his project in a semester (and Winter Study). An honors candidate will prepare a forty page thesis or its equivalent while
enrolled in the senior thesis course, 491 or 492 (and Winter Study). This course will be in addition to the courses required to fulfill the concentration.
A student wishing to become a candidate for honors in International Studies should secure a faculty sponsor and inform the program chair in writing before
spring registration of her/his junior year.
INST 101(F) Is the World Flat? An Introduction to International Studies
The economic, technological, political and cultural processes that have been gathered together under the term `globalization' have been championed by many as
the inevitable face of the future of the world. Some have eloquently questioned the overlooked inequalities that arise from these processes, while still others have
questioned the inevitability of the processes that the term signals. This course will approach these issues with four sustained case studies that will attend especially
to the areas of economic development strategies, global health, democracy promotion and conflict resolution. We will begin with a focus on two debates: about
`globalization' among Thomas Friedman, Joseph Stiglitz, David Harvey and Jagdhish Bhagwati and economic development between Jeffrey Sachs, Amartya
Sen and William Easterly. We will then turn to four case studies: small scale development strategies in Egypt and India, democratization and human rights promo-
tion in Latin America and the former Soviet Union, combating tuberculosis in the Caribbean and Africa and conflict resolution efforts in Africa and Central Asia.
We will take these case studies as concrete instances to think through the shape of the world we will live in for the coming decades.
Format: lecture and discussion. Evaluation will be based on four 4- to 5-page response papers and one oral presentation.
No prerequisites: Open to all classes. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 30). Preference given to first-year students.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR DARROW

2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
The United States' continuing and troubled attempt to remake the Persian Gulf region provides an occasion for critical reflection on the questions asked and tools
available from the International Studies perspective for understanding other nations and regions. This course will examine aspects of the cultural, political, eco-
nomic and technological dimensions of the nations of Iraq and Iran. The course will begin with a consideration of the history, religions, and societies of these two
neighbors as well as the specific features of an oil rentier economy. The course will then turn to the recent experiences of these two nations in the international
arena including strategies of sanctions, regime change and democratization prosecuted primarily by the United States. We will pay special attention to the as-
sumptions about the role and character of the state, the character of civil society and the processes of economic and cultural globalization that lie behind these
strategies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two short papers and a final research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.

INST 101(S) Asia and the World (Same as Asian Studies 201 and Political Science 100)
Asia looms large in contemporary world politics: Japan is gradually assuming an expanded regional national security role; The People's Republic of China is
emerging as a multifaceted Great Power; India is challenged by rising ethno-nationalism. This course will explore both the historical background and current
dynamics of political and economic issues in these three countries, drawing on themes of imperialism, nationalism, and globalization. It is an introductory class
177
and, therefore, no prior coursework in political science or Asian studies is necessary.
Format: predominately lecture. Requirements: two short papers and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 60 (expected: 60).

offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
The collapse of the Soviet Union, the recognition of untapped mineral wealth, and Islamic resurgence have all led to an increased focus on Central Asia and its
neighbors, Russia, China, the Middle East. This course will be an introduction to the Caucasus, the Central Asian Republics, Xinjiang and Mongolia and the
interests of their neighbors, including now the United States in those areas. This will be a lecture course that will introduce the salient themes and issues that are
necessary for understanding these areas. The course will inevitably be deeply comparative focusing on themes of "the clash of civilizations," the construction of
national identities, notions of ethnicity and the treatment of ethnic minorities, resurgent religious movements, and the relation of state and civil society. This course
will also function as an introduction to doing social scientific research on these areas and special attention will be devoted to the preparation of a research paper.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: weekly responses, three short essays (4-6 pages), and one research paper (12-15 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 15). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.

This course is open to concentrators in all tracks who will not be able to meet the senior exercise requirement in another context. This will be a shared team taught
research seminar that will culminate in the completion of a final research paper (20-25 pages). The seminar will meet jointly for the first four weeks to explore
issues in the field of International Studies. This will be followed by four weeks of individual research developed in consultation with appropriate faculty followed
in the last four weeks by the presentation of that research.

JEWISH STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor STEVEN GERRARD
Advisory Committee: Professor: GERRARD. Associate Professor: S. FOX*. Assistant Professors: DEKEL, GARBARINI, HAMMERSCHLAG*.
THE PROGRAM IN JEWISH STUDIES
Jewish Studies is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses the texts, history, languages, philosophy, and culture of Jews and Judaism as they have changed
over three millennia and throughout the world. The program offers courses in multiple disciplines including but not limited to Religion, Classics, History, Philoso-
phy, Anthropology, Sociology, and Comparative Literature. Across these disciplines, the program examines topics such as religious belief and practice, textual
interpretation, the development of Zionism, life in the Diaspora, the historicization and memorialization of the Holocaust, and historical, political and philosophi-
cal questions surrounding Jewish identity. Investigating the foundations and development of these various Jewish topics, as well as their interaction with and
influence on other traditions, provides an opportunity to explore the continuities and diversity of Jewish life and thought. Students will gain exposure to a common
body of knowledge and scholarly approaches through which to engage in their own rich and varied intellectual explorations of Jewish and related topics.
CONCENTRATION IN JEWISH STUDIES
The concentration in Jewish Studies requires five courses with at least two different prefixes: one gateway course, two core courses, one elective, and one
capstone course.
Gateway Courses:
JWST 101/REL 203 Judaism: Innovation and Tradition
JWST/COMP/REL 201 The Hebrew Bible
Core Courses
COMP/JWST 352 Writing after the Disaster: The Literature of Exile
HIST/JWST 230 Modern European Jewish History 17891948
HIST/JWST 338 The History of the Holocaust
HIST/JWST 490T Memory, History, and the Extermination of the Jews in Europe

REL/JWST/COMP 209 The Legend of the Wandering Jew
REL 303/REL 280/ PHIL 282 The Turn to Religion in PostModern Thought (W)
Students can check with the program chair to see if other courses not listed here might count as electives.
Electives
Students may meet the elective requirement with a course partially related to Jewish Studies or another core course. In a core course partially related to Jewish
Studies, a student will normally focus at least one of the major writing assignments on a topic relevant to Jewish Studies or approximately one-third of the course
will be devoted to Jewish subjects. The list of relevant electives changes regularly, so the course catalog should be checked for details. Listed below are examples
of courses partially related to Jewish Studies. Students may meet the elective requirement with a course not listed here, subject to the approval of the Chair of
Jewish Studies.

Croghan Professorship
Each year, in addition to the regular course offerings listed above, Williams sponsors the Croghan Bicentennial Visiting Professor in Religion who offers one
course in Judaism and/or Christianity. Past Croghan Professors have taught courses on the Mishnah (Shaye Cohen), the historical Jesus (John Dominic Crossan),
and Ancient Mediterranean Religions (Ross Kraemer).
Overseas Studies
Studying in Israel is highly recommended for students interested in Jewish Studies. Many students have spent a semester or year at Hebrew University. With
the approval of the Jewish Studies program chair, students may count a study-abroad program towards on core requirement.
Funding
The Bronfman Fund for Judaic Studies was established in 1980 by Edgar M. Bronfman '50, Samuel Bronfman II '75, and Matthew Bronfman '80. The
Bronfman Fund provides opportunities for the Williams community to learn about Jewish history and culture, both within the College's formal curriculum and
through the planning of major events on Jewish themes.
The Morris Wiener and Stephen R. Wiener '56 Fund for Jewish Studies was established in 1997 through the estate of Stephen R. Wiener '56. The Wiener gifts
have provided an endowment to support a faculty position in modern Jewish thought, and are used to underwrite an annual lecture, forum or event relevant to
contemporary Jewish life.

Latina/o Studies is an interdisciplinary and comparative field of study that explores the histories and experiences of Latinas and Latinos in the United States.
Latinas and Latinos include peoples who come from or whose ancestors come from Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. The program seeks to
cover the widest range of experiences, encompassing Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Dominicans, as well as more recent migrations from a
wide variety of Central and South American countries. Courses, most of which use a comparative approach, seek to provide students with the tools to continue
their work in areas of their particular interest. Focusing on a diverse group with a long history in the United States, which is also one of the fastest growing
populations in the contemporary era, provides an opportunity to explore complex dynamics globally and within the context of the United States. The program
examines topics such as the political and economic causes of migration, the impact of globalization, economic incorporation, racialization, the formation and
reformulations of identities and communities, the uses of urban spaces, inter-ethnic relations, artistic expression, aesthetics, and visual and popular culture.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in Latina/o Studies requires five courses. Students are required to take the introductory course (LATS 105), one 400-level Latina/o Studies
seminar, and three electives. Two electives must be core electives, and one elective can be a related course in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies or in Coun-
tries of Origin and Transnationalism. The three electives must include two different areas of study, and at least one elective must be at the 300 or 400 level.
Additional courses may be approved by the Chair. Students, especially those considering graduate work or professional careers in the field, are encouraged to
enroll in Spanish language courses at Williams.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS
Honors in Latina/o Studies may be granted to concentrators after an approved candidate completes an honors project, delivers a public presentation of the
work, and is awarded an honors grade by her/his advisor and two other faculty readers. In consultation with the advisor and the chair, faculty readers may be from
outside the Latina/o Studies Program.
The honors project will be completed over one semester plus winter study. It may consist of a conventional research thesis of 40-70 pages or of other forms of
presentation (e.g., video, art, theater). It may also combine a shorter research thesis with another medium.
To be accepted as a candidate for honors in Latina/o Studies, a student must meet these criteria:
1) Submit and earn approval of a project proposal in April of the junior year. The proposal should be no longer than 5 pages and should lay out the project's
aim and methodology, identify the student's advisor for the work, and include evidence of competence in the necessary media for projects that include
non-thesis forms.
183
2) Achieve a grade point average of at least 3.33 in LATS courses at the time of application.
Students admitted to the honors program must submit a 5-8 page revised proposal, with an annotated bibliography, by the second week of classes in the fall
semester of her/his senior year. They should register either for LATS 493 in the fall semester and LATS 031 in Winter Study, or for LATS 031 in Winter Study and
LATS 494 in the spring semester. These courses will be in addition to the 5 courses that make up the regular concentration.
STUDY ABROAD
Study abroad and other off-campus programs offer excellent opportunities for students to build on, and expand, the intellectual interests they develop as part of
the Latina/o Studies concentration. Through their connections to various institutions in the U.S. and other nations, Latina/o Studies faculty can help place students
in U.S. borderlands programs as well as programs in Mexico, Cuba, and other "countries of origin." Any student seeking to include courses as part of a concentra-
tion in Latina/o Studies should feel free to contact the Program chair or other faculty. A maximum of 1 course taken away from Williams can count (as an elective)
toward the completion of the concentration.
LATS 105(F) Latina/o Identities: Constructions, Contestations, and Expressions
What, or who, is a Hispanic or Latina/o? At present, individuals living in the United States who are classified as such number approximately 40 million, constitut-
ing the country's largest "minority" group. In this course, we will study the interdisciplinary field that has emerged in response to this growing population, as we
focus on the complex nature of "identity." Viewing identities as historically and socially constructed, we begin with a brief assessment of how racial, ethnic, class,
and gendered identities take shape in the Hispanic Caribbean and Latin America. We then examine the impact of (im)migration and the rearticulation of identities
in the United States, as we compare each group's unique history, settlement patterns, and transnational activity. Identity is also a contested terrain. As immigrants
and migrants arrive, the United States' policymakers, the media, and others seek to define the "newcomers" along with long-term Latina/o citizens. At the same
time, Latinas/os rearticulate, live, assert, and express their own sense of identity. In this light, we conclude the course with an exploration of these diverse expres-
sions as they relate to questions of class, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and national origins.
Format: discussion. Evaluation to be based on student participation and several short papers (1-5 pages) throughout the semester.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20-25). Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR RA and CEPEDA
LATS 203 Chicana/o Film and Video (Same as ArtH 203) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Hollywood cinema has long been fascinated with the border between the United States and Mexico. This course will examine representations of the U.S.-Mexico
border, Mexican Americans, and Chicana/os in both Hollywood film and independent media. We will consider how positions on nationalism, race, gender,
identity, migration, and history are represented and negotiated through film. We will begin by analyzing Hollywood "border" and gang films before approaching
Chicana/o-produced features, independent narratives, and experimental work. This course will explore issues of film and ideology, genre and representation,
nationalist resistance and feminist critiques, queer theory and the performative aspects of identity.
Format: film screenings will be scheduled as a lab. Evaluation will be based on one short paper, mid-term exam, final exam and take home essays.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 20).

LATS 209(F) Spanish for Heritage Speakers: Introduction to Latina/o Cultural Production (Same as Spanish 209)
This course emphasizes the acquisition and/or improvement of critical communication and analytical skills in Spanish for use both in and outside of the United
States. We address all four of the primary language skills (listening, reading, writing, and speaking), with particular attention to the unique needs of students who
have received a majority of their exposure to the Spanish language in an informal/domestic environment. Through the use of meaningful materials and vocabu-
lary taken from a variety of Spanish-language contexts--but with primary emphasis on the numerous U.S. Latina/o communities--this course aims to sharpen
heritage speakers' sociolinguistic competency and ability to interpret Spanish-language musical, cinematic, and literary texts in the target language. Ultimately,
students will be prepared for a variety of "real-world," cross-cultural contexts and will be more knowledgeable regarding Latina/o cultural production.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short writing assignments (13 pages each), two oral exams, and an oral presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Open to all heritage speakers of Spanish. Preference given to Latina/o concentrators.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR CEPEDA
LATS 220(F) Introduction to Urban Studies: Shaping and Living the City (Same as American Studies 221)
Generally, cities have been described either as vibrant commercial and cultural centers or as violent and decaying urban slums. In an effort to begin to think more
critically about cities, this course introduces important topics in the interdisciplinary field of Urban Studies. Specifically, we will discuss concepts and theories
used to examine the peoples and structures that make up cities: In what ways do socio-cultural, economic, and political factors affect urban life and development?
How are cities planned and used by various stakeholders (politicians, developers, businesses, and residents)? How do people make meaning of the places they
inhabit? We will pay particular attention to the roles of race, ethnicity, class, and gender in understanding and interpreting urban communities. Texts include works
by anthropologists, historians, sociologists, cultural critics, cultural geographers, and literary writers.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, group presentations and discussions, and 2 short essays (5-8 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to American Studies majors and Latina/o Studies concentrators.

LATS 230(F) Approaching Performance Studies (Same as Theatre 230 and Women and Gender Studies 231)
Theatre, music, dance, performance art, community activism, public gatherings, sports, eating, and rituals all fall under the rubric of "performance." Performance
studies is an interdisciplinary field that explores these types of live, embodied activities as cultural acts and as theoretical paradigms. This course is an introduction
to performance studies and to its theoretical bases in anthropology, dramatic theory, poststructuralism, psychoanalytic theory, folklore, cultural studies, philoso-
phy, feminist theory, and queer theory. We will devote particular attention to performances that reflect the complexity and diversity of race and ethnicity in the
United States. In addition to reading and discussing theory, we will study local live and recorded performances. This course combines theory and practice in order
to understand performance as a critical space. On the practical level, students are expected to attend three workshops with Professor Omar Sangare to experiment
with their body, voice, and the stage. These workshops will provide the foundation for students' final performance. This course also serves as the introduction
course for the Performance Studies Program.
Format: discussion. Requirements: several short writing assignments, attendance at live performances and workshops, final essay and final performance.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). Preference to Latina/o Studies concentrators, and to Art and Theatre majors. Not open to first-year stu-
dents.

LATS 235(F) (formerly 335) Latina/o Theatre and Performance, 1950-2000 (Same as American Studies 235, Comparative Literature 268,
Theatre 235 and Women's and Gender Studies 235) (D)
This course explores Latina/o theatre and performance from the 1950's to the late 1990's. We will cover a broad range of theatrical practices, from mainstream
Broadway productions to grass roots community actos, from site-specific interventions in the US/Mexico border region to the use of vernacular aesthetic practic-
es such as choteo, relajo and rascuachismo. One of the course's goals is to introduce some of the screenplays that have become canons within Chicana/o, Puerto
Rican and Cuban theatre in the United States. The course also introduces the centrality of Latina feminist and queer thought to theater and performance. We will
pay particular attention to the connections between social movements and popular culture, during an era that illustrates Latinas/os' articulation of ethnic and
cultural self-identification.
Format: discussion. Requirements: four short essays and one final assignment.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 10).
Hour: 1:10-3:50 W JOTTAR
LATS 240 Latina/o Language and Literature: Hybrid Voices in Contemporary Context (Same as American Studies 240, Comparative
Literature 210, and Linguistics 254) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (D)
In this course we will focus on issues of language and identity in the contemporary literary production and lived experiences of various Latina/o communities. As
such, how are cultural values and material conditions expressed through Latina/o language and literature? How does Latina/o identity challenge traditional no-
tions of the relationship between language, culture, and nation? In what ways might Latina/o literary and linguistic practices serve as tools for social change?
Departing from an overview of common linguistic phenomena such as code-switching (popularly known as"Spanglish") and Latina/o English, we will examine
bilingual education, recent linguistic legislation, and the English Only movement. Throughout the course we will survey texts culled from a variety of literary and
performance genres, ranging from the poetry of the Chicano and Puerto Rican Movements of the 1960s and 1970s to more recent theatrical pieces, novels, poetry,
and short stories by writers such as Sandra Cisneros, Junot Daz, Martn Espada, Vctor Hernndez Cruz, Jaime Manrique, Dolores Prida, Michelle Serros, and
184
Helena Mara Viramontes, among others. Both directly and/or indirectly, these texts address Latina/o language politics, as well as the broader themes of identity,
power, community, race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and hybridity.
Format: discussion. Requirements: class participation, several short writing assignments (1-5 pages each), an oral presentation, and a final exam.

LATS 241 Redefining the "Helping Hand:" Community-based Approaches to Latinas/os in the Northern Berkshires (Not offered
2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
With a specific focus on the "politics of helping" with regard to the Northern Berkshires' Latin American immigrant population, this courses centers on the new
face (la nueva cara) of a Latina/o identity rooted in the region's rural, as opposed to urban, spaces. We begin with an historic, political and cultural overview of
both Berkshire County and the Latina/o populations who comprise the majority of its newest immigrants. Students will then be trained in formal interviewing
techniques. After a brief period of information-gathering, establishing community contacts and interviewing Latina/o immigrant residents, each two-person stu-
dent team will identify an experiential learning project that they feel best addresses a particular need within their partner organization and within the Latina/o
immigrant community itself. Student teams will have the option of working in conjunction with any one or more of the following individuals or organizations for
the remainder of the semester: Brayton Elementary School's English as a Second Language (ESL) program (North Adams), the Berkshire Immigrant Center
(Pittsfield), Manos Unidas (Pittsfield), the Northern Berkshire Community Coalition (North Adams), Northern Berkshires Adult Basic Education, or local Amer-
icorps VISTA members (Williamstown and North Adams). At the semester's end, student teams will be required to present their partner organizations or individ-
uals with a completed product in keeping with the most pressing community needs identified in their initial research.
Format: discussion and experiential learning. Requirements: class and site participation, several short writing assignments (15 pages each), and final presenta-
tion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected 10).

LATS 258 Latina/o Installation and Site-Specific Art (Same as ArtH 258) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This course will explore the various forms of installation and site-specific artworks created by Latina/o artists for both museums and public space. We will
examine the ways in which Latina/o artists have used space as a material in the production of artworks and how this impacts the works' meanings and the
viewer's experience. Within the context of U.S. Latina/o culture and history, we will connect notions of space with ideas about cultural citizenship, civil rights,
and social justice. A variety of art forms will be studied, from traditional to experimental, including murals, sculpture, performance, video, and several multime-
dia, interactive, or participatory projects. While establishing a historical lineage and theoretical frameworks for analyzing this growing genre, we will pay particu-
lar attention to how these works engage urban space and often challenge the institutional assumptions of museums and curatorial practice. Likewise, we will
examine the important debates associated with various public art and museum installation controversies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two short papers, periodic research reports, final research paper, and presentation.
Prerequisites: Latina/o Studies 105 or ArtH 101-102 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12). Preference to Latina/o Studies concentrators
and to Art majors.

offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (D)
This interdisciplinary course examines the emergence of Latino cities in the US. We begin by exploring urban centers that came to be identified with certain
Latino groups Puerto Ricans in New York, Mexicans in Los Angeles, and Cubans in Miami. We then turn to other Latino cities that have been historically
overlooked given the popular and scholarly attention placed on New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. In our study of Latino cities, we will analyze the diverse
histories of migration and settlement, inter-ethnic and inter-racial relations, community building and identity formation, and the racialization of urban spaces.
Finally, we will consider the situatedness of latinidad in these urban environments contemplating how Latinos are shaped by and in turn shape the experience of
the city in the US.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, field research, 4 response papers (2 pages), a short field narrative (4 pages), a midterm essay (5-7
pages), and a final review essay (8-10 pages).
Prerequisites: Latina/o Studies 220/American Studies 221 recommended. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12). Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators
and American Studies majors.

LATS 312(S) Chicago (Same as American Studies 312)
"The city of big shoulders has plenty of room for diversity," reads the official visitor's website for the City of Chicago. Focusing on this claim, this course asks
students to think critically about what kind room has been made for diversity--social, spatial, and ideological. Additionally we examine the ways in which
diverse social actors have shouldered their way into the imagined and physical landscape of the city. Working with ethnography, history, literature, critical essays,
and popular culture, we will explore the material and discursive constructions of Chi-Town and urban life among its residents. Appreciating these constructions
we also consider how Chicago has served as a key site for understandings of urbanity within a broader national and global context.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on attendance and class participation, group presentations and discussions, and 2 short essays (5 pages) and a book
review essay (10-12 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to American Studies majors, Latina/o Studies concentrators, and students who have taken

Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR RA
LATS 332(S) Latinos and Education: The Politics of Schooling, Language, and Latino Studies (Same as American Studies 332) (W) (D)
Schools have often become the focal point for debates over the relationship between cultural identity, intellectual abilities, and the production of knowledge. What
should be taught, who should be taught, and how they should be taught frame the politics of schooling. Language has often taken center stage in these debates.
This course examines the effects of educational policies and practices on the development of Latina/o students and communities. We will also consider how these
students and communities have resourcefully carved out spaces and made demands to meet their educational needs. Topics include school desegregation, bilin-
gual education, student walk-outs and sit-ins, as well as the origins and advancement of Chicano Studies, Puerto Rican Studies, and more recently Latino Studies
programs on college campuses. Students will critically engage the major themes of the course in two essays as they also engage each other in the form of peer-re-
views and other in-class writing workshop exercises. This course explores the experiences and expressions of racially and culturally diverse Latinas and Latinos,
focusing on the myriad ways in which they confront, negotiate, and at times challenge dominant U.S. hierarchies of race, culture, gender and class.
Format: discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, writing workshop participation (and related assignments), group presentations, and two es-
says (12-15 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12). Preference given to Latina/o Studies concentrators.

LATS 338 Theorizing Popular Culture: Latinas/os and the Dynamics of the Everyday (Same as American Studies 339 and Comparative
Literature 338) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W) (D)
Via the critical analysis of select musical, cinematic, literary, and popular media texts, we will investigate the primary approaches to the study of popular expres-
sion and identity, with particular emphasis on Latina/o popular cultural production. This course will focus on the following questions: How is Latina/o identity
expressed through the "popular" or the everyday? In which ways does the study of Latina/o popular culture illuminate our understanding of the Latina/o commu-
nity's history and culture? What methodologies or theoretical approaches are best suited to the analysis of the "here and now"? Employing a broad range of
current Cultural Studies theories and methods, students will conduct an original semester-long research project and complete various ethnographic exercises in
this analysis of the historical, socio-political, and artistic uses of popular culture among Latinas/os.
Format: discussion. Requirements: class participation, several short writing assignments (13 pages each), oral presentation, and a final paper (15-20 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10). Preference to Latina/o Studies concentrators and Comparative Literature majors.

As Latina/o Studies and Media Studies scholars have long noted, the media plays a key role in the construction of (trans)national identities. As such, this interdis-
ciplinary course will focus on the areas of advertising, print media, radio, television, media policy and audience studies in an attempt to answer the following:
How do Latinos construct identity (and have their identities constructed for them) through the media? How are Latina/o community practices shaped by the
media, and vice versa? What research methodologies best capture the complex relationship between consumer, producer, and media text? How are Latina/o
stereotypes constructed and circulated in mass media? Where do issues of consumer agency come into play? How might media provide a means for affecting
social change at both the local and global levels? In what ways do popular media impact our understanding of race, gender, sexuality, class and nation? Readings
include literary and theoretical works by contemporary writers and scholars such as Arlene Dvila, Alberto Fuguet, Vicki Mayer, Yeidy Rivero, Amrica
Rodrguez, and Angharad Valdivia.
Format: discussion. Requirements: student participation, 1 student-led discussion period, several short papers throughout the semester (3-5 pages each), final

LATS 375(F) Performance and Its Traces (Same as Theatre 375)
This is an inter-disciplinary video production workshop that explores visual strategies to produce and re-produce performance practices such as: performance art,
ritual, dance, music, spoken-word and media spectacles. At the theoretical level, we will study performance as a practical, aesthetic and theoretical terrain, and as
a historical site that produces knowledge in its relationship to the politics and power of representation, culture and memory. We will engage with various practices
of documenting performance such as visual anthropology, docu-drama, ethnographic surrealism, dance for the camera, and other experimental approaches. In
addition to the discussion of assigned readings, students will attend weekly video/film screenings, produce their own videos, and critique other students' video
projects. For their final projects, students will produce a video and write a final paper analyzing the production process in relationship to the theoretical readings
from the course.
Format: discussion. Requirements: several short response papers, four short videos assignments, a final video project, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: Latina/o Studies 230 and/or ArtS 288 recommended. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected 10). Preference to Latina/o Studies concentrators, and to

The metaphor of "home" and idea of "belonging" bring insight to theories and investigations centered on community building and identity formation within and
across national borders. These constructions give us an indication of what people value, what is worth fighting for, as well as what is considered expendable. Our
objective in this course is to interrogate constructions of home and belonging by studying how individuals, communities, and nations are transformed by experi-
ences of dislocation, migration, and renewed place-making. What are the ways a sense of belonging shapes these identities and the investments made in these
formations? Working with ethnography, history, memoir, literature, critical essays, and documentary film, we will consider the personal and political uses and
meanings of memory, nostalgia, and imagination in "rooting" migrating subjects in place and time. Among the many case studies we will examine are the politics
of homeland among Cuban-Americans, Native American and West Indian festive forms, and place-claiming and racial sincerity among African Americans. This
course explores the experiences and expressions of racialized populations in the United States, focusing on the myriad ways in which they confront, negotiate, and
at times challenge dominant U.S. hierarchies of race, culture, gender and class.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, annotated bibliography, short essay, writing workshop participation (and related assignments),
research paper related assignments, and a final research paper and presentation.
Prerequisites: prior courses in Latino Studies, American Studies, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 15). Preference given to senior Latino
Studies concentrators and American Studies majors.

LATS 409(S) Tracing the Roots of Routes: Comparative Transnationalisms (Same as American Studies 409) (W) (D)
In the age of satellite television, e-mail, and readily available international phone cards, transnationalism has rapidly become the norm as opposed to the excep-
tion. However, what does it really mean to "be transnational"? How do the lived experiences of transnational individuals and communities merge with (and differ
from) theoretical notions of the transnational? How do the practices and concepts of diaspora, globalization, and transnationalism overlap? How does the growing
number of transnational citizens and residents in this country shape "American" identity on the local, national, and global scales? In this interdisciplinary, compar-
ative course we will analyze contemporary theories regarding the origins and impacts of transnationalism, key critiques regarding the field of transnational studies
itself, and transnationalism's role in the "New" American Studies. Case studies examined in this course include China, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Haiti,
India, Mexico and the Philippines.
Format: discussion. Evaluation to be based on student participation, the completion of an original research paper conducted in stages (abstract, annotated bibliog-
raphy, outline, and multiple drafts), and peer editing.

LATS 471(F) Comparative Latina/o Migrations (Same as History 471) (D) (W)
Since the 1970s, policymakers, scholars, the media, and popular discourses have used the umbrella terms "Hispanic" and "Latina/o" to refer to Mexicans, Puerto
Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans and more recent immigrants from Central and South American countries. As a form of racial/ethnic categorization, however, these
umbrella terms can mask widely divergent migration histories and experiences in the United States. In this course, we develop theoretical perspectives and com-
parative analyses to untangle a complicated web of similarities and differences among Latino groups. How important were their time of arrival and region of
settlement? How do we explain differences in socioeconomic status? How fruitful and appropriate are comparative analyses with other racial/ethnic groups, such
as African Americans or European immigrants? Along the way, we explore the emergence of Latina/o Studies as an interdisciplinary and comparative field of
study, as well as methods used in Latino and Latina history, specifically oral histories, government documents, newspapers, and interdisciplinary approaches. In
this EDI course, we ask whether the history and processes of racialization in the United States has created similarities and/or differences in each group's experi-
ences, and to what extent the field of Latina/o Studies offers an alternative to racial biases embedded in the dominant academic discourses.
Format: seminar/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation and presentations, a proposal, an annotated bibliography, a short historiographical
essay, and a research paper based in part on primary sources.

LEADERSHIP STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor JAMES MCALLISTER

MAN, MELLOW***. Stanley Kaplan Visiting Professor: TBA. Visiting Lecturer: G. CHANDLER. Stanley Kaplan Post-Doctoral Fellow:

Leadership Studies focuses on the universal phenomenon of leadership in human groups. Leadership Studies asks what leadership means within a wide variety
of social contexts-whether in a family, a team, a theatre company, a philanthropy, a university, a multinational corporation, or a nation state waging war. It seeks to
understand the dynamics of the relationships between leaders and followers. It studies authority, power, and influence. It seeks to grasp the bases of legitimacy that
leaders claim, and followers grant, in all of these relationships.
Through a wide range of courses in the social sciences and the humanities, a number of questions are addressed through the curriculum. How have men and
women defined leadership and what are the bases of leaders' legitimacy in different historical contexts? How do leaders in different contexts emerge? Through
tradition, charisma, or legal sanction? How do different types of leaders exercise and maintain their domination? What are the distinctive habits of mind of leaders
in different historical contexts? What are the moral dilemmas that leaders in different contexts face? What are the typical challenges to established leadership in
different historical contexts? How does one analyze the experiences of leaders in widely disparate contexts to generate systematic comparative understandings of
why history judges some leaders great and others failures. How and why do these evaluations about the efficacy of leaders shift over time?
To meet the requirements of the concentration, students must complete one of the two sequences outlined below (6 courses total).

LEAD 125(F) Power, Leadership and Legitimacy: An Introduction to Leadership Studies (Same as Political Science 125)
Leadership has long been a central concept in the study of politics. Philosophers from Plato to Machiavelli have struggled with the question of what qualities and
methods are necessary for effective leadership. Social scientists throughout the twentieth century have struggled to refine and advance hypotheses about leader-
ship in the areas of economics, psychology, and sociology. Nevertheless, despite all of this impressive intellectual effort, the study of leadership remains a con-
tested field of study precisely because universal answers to the major questions in leadership studies have proven to be elusive. This course is designed to
introduce students to many of the central issues and debates in the area of leadership studies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a midterm and final exam and two short papers.

In the late-eighteenth century, two revolutions burst forth-they were the most striking and consequential events in modern history, decisive turning-points that
transformed society and politics. This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the overarching ideas and visions of the sister revolutions.
Through works of literature, correspondence, political essays and speeches, we will seek to understand the fundamental goals and accomplishments of both
revolutions. Who were their leaders and according to what principles did they govern? Did revolutionaries in France find a model in America for their Revolu-
tion? What is the meaning of the "Terror" in France and what light does it shed on modern revolutionary movements? Why was the American Revolution
followed by decades of stability while the French Revolution bequeathed a turbulent succession of failed governments? Have America and France continued to
conceive of themselves as revolutionary nations? We will read works by the following historians, novelists, and politicians: Rousseau, Robespierre, Saint-Just,
Michelet,Tocqueville, Victor Hugo, Edmund Burke, Thomas Paine, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, David B. Davis, and
Hannah Arendt.

LEAD 250(S) Political Leadership
This course will examine the leadership strategies of American political leaders with an emphasis on the importance of communication strategies for public sector
leaders. We will study these issues by examining local, state and federal political leaders and by answering key questions specific to the political realm. We will
read and watch significant speeches of American political leaders, be visited by guests with deep knowledge and insight into the world of politics and read a
variety of writings by academics and practitioners on the subject. We will explore questions such as "What characteristics mark successful communication and
how do leaders craft a unique and effective communications style?" and "What strategic considerations are there for female political leaders and do they have
different challenges in communicating?"
The first series of classes will focus on communication--taking a look at some of America's best political orators, the special requirements of crisis communica-
tion and the changes that new media has brought to the practice of politics and government. We will then explore the tenets of political strategy-- both in cam-
paigns and governing. This segment of the course will take a look at the tools used in crafting a strategy and how to put together a winning coalition. The final
classes in the course will explore the unique challenges and opportunities facing select sub-groups of political leaders: women, celebrity candidates and office-
holders and high-achieving young political leaders--operatives and elected officials.

The American Revolution produced a galaxy of brilliant politicians and statesmen of extraordinary courage, intellect, creativity, and character. They succeeded in
drafting an unparalleled Constitution and establishing enduring democratic political institutions while nevertheless failing to grapple with the wrenching issue of
slavery and the rights of women. In this course, we will explore the lives, ideas, and political leadership of these men, most of whom belonged to the social elite of
their day:Washington, Madison, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, and Hamilton. We will study in depth their superb writings, such as the correspondence between
Madison and Jefferson and between John Adams and his wife Abigail, and Madison's and Hamilton's Federalist essays. We will also read recent interpretations
of the founding generation by Gordon Wood, Joseph Ellis, Edmund Morgan, Bernard Bailyn, and others.

LEAD 295(F) Leadership and Management
What are the differences between effective leaders and effective managers of complex organizations, or are they one and the same? If different, what are the key
elements making each successful, and are there any critical dynamics or interdependencies between these elements? Finally, are there important distinctions
between the factors required for success by leaders/managers in different domains, in different cultures, or of different genders? In this course, we will wrestle
with these questions by examining both successful and unsuccessful leadership and management of complex organizations in a number of domains, potentially
including business, non-profit, higher education, government agencies, and others. Our primary means of doing so will be through case studies, supplemented by
readings from several noted leadership and management thinkers.
Format: seminar. Course requirements will include active class participation, several brief (1 page or less) response papers, a short midterm paper, and a longer
final paper, which develops and analyzes a case of the student's choice. This latter paper can be done individually or in groups of two.

as well as some of the most controversial--Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. We will investigate how these presidents developed as leaders before as well as
after their election to the presidency. How did they determine their goals, assemble their leadership teams, and mobilize followers? What challenges did they face
and what principles guided them? What failures did they meet and why? Can we relate these historical examples to the American presidency today? Readings
will include correspondence, speeches, biographies, and political analysis.

styles? Did they mobilize followers or did their followers mobilize them? How did they balance political compromise with bold, principled leadership? How did
their personalities affect their visions and their goals? To what extent did they offer ethical and moral leadership? In addition to studying histories and biographies,
we will do extensive research in primary source material.

LEGAL STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor LAWRENCE KAPLAN
Advisory Committee: Professors: JACKALL, JUST, KAPLAN, KASSIN**, NOLAN, SHANKS*. Assistant Professor: SINIAWER. Visiting Assis-
tant Professor: A. HIRSCH.
Legal Studies is an interdisciplinary program designed to give students a background and frameworks for understanding the law as a means of regulating
human behavior and resolving disputes among individuals, groups, and governments. Emanating from a liberal arts tradition, and not specifically aimed at pre-
paring students for law school, this program provides the tools needed to think and argue critically about how laws work, how they evolved in the course of
history and in different parts of the world, how they are enforced, and how they affect our everyday lives.
The courses in this program address a wide range of subjects, including the philosophical, moral, historical, social, and political underpinnings of law; the U.S.
Constitution; law enforcement and other aspects of criminal justice; methods of scientific proof; psychological influences on evidence, trials, and decision-mak-
ing; cultural perspectives and non-western legal traditions; and the use of law to regulate environmental policy. Courses are taught by faculty in the Sciences,
Social Sciences, and Humanities, whose work centers on legal processes, and by visiting professors from various law schools.
THE CONCENTRATION
The concentration in legal studies consists of six courses, including an interdisciplinary introductory course, four electives taken from at least two departments,
and a senior seminar on a contemporary topic in the law. Electives may vary from year to year according to course offerings. In addition, the program offers local,
alumni, and professional contacts for summer and WSP internships in a wide range of government and private law-related settings.
STUDY ABROAD
Students who choose to study abroad should consult with the Program Chair to insure that they can complete the requirements. Studying abroad may provide
exciting opportunities to learn about legal traditions and systems other than those of the United States. Students should check with the Chair to be sure that courses
taken abroad will be counted toward completion of the Program.
REQUIRED COURSES

(Criticism)
LGST 401(S) Senior Seminar: Law and Philosophy
The notion of criminal responsibility and corollary issues such as the insanity defense are inextricably linked with the problem of free will. Disputes over methods
of legal interpretation implicate and sometimes invoke different epistemological premises. The contours of the criminal law, such as the propriety of capital
punishment and outlawing allegedly victimless behavior, are inseparable from ethical theory. So too, the appropriate conduct of criminal defense attorneys who
know or believe their clients are guilty raises profound ethical questions. In short, major questions of law are informed by philosophical perspectives. This course
explores the intersections of law and philosophy, focusing on the five areas alluded to--criminal responsibility, interpretation, the death penalty, victimless
crimes, and the attorney's ethical code. Readings will include major philosophers (e.g., Kant, Mill, and Rorty), legal theorists (e.g., Dworkin and Scalia), and
writers who fall into neither category but who have opined provocatively on matters related to relevant issues (e.g., Stanley Fish and Allan Bloom).
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, several short papers, and a substantially longer final paper.
Prerequisites: Legal Studies 101 and at least two Legal Studies electives, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20-25). Preference will be
given, in order of seniority, to students for whom this course completes the Legal Studies concentration.

LINGUISTICS (Div. I)
Coordinator, Assistant Professor: NATHAN SANDERS
Assistant Professor: SANDERS.
Courses in linguistics enable students to explore language from a variety of perspectives: the internal workings of language as a system of communication, the
physical means by which speech is produced, the role of language in society, the history of language groups and specific languages, and the applicability of
scientific knowledge about language to various human endeavors.
Linguistics offers neither a major nor a concentration, but its courses provide a solid grounding in formal linguistics and complement study in several other
disciplines: Anthropology, Philosophy, Computer Science, Psychology, Cognitive Science, Sociology, English, Comparative Literature, and all the foreign lan-
guages.
Some departments and programs also count courses in linguistics towards credit for their majors or concentrations. In particular, Anthropology majors can
receive major credit for Linguistics 100, Asian Studies majors may take linguistics courses to fulfill their three course qualification, German majors may receive
major credit for a linguistics course with the special permission of the department chair, and Cognitive Science concentrators can take Linguistics 100 and 220 as
electives.
Knowledge of foreign languages is helpful but not required for introductory linguistics courses.
LING 100 Introduction to Linguistics (Same as Anthropology 107) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This course provides a general introduction to the scientific study of language by means of systematic exploration of the inherent similarities and surprising
differences across human languages. Using actual data from real languages, students will learn the basic methodology, important results, and major theoretical
debates from various subfields of linguistics, including phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, language change, and sociolinguistics. Additional
topics may include sign languages, language acquisition, the politics of language, and animal communication.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, one or two midterm exams, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Preference given to students needing the course to satisfy prerequisites for future courses or to fulfill re-
quirements for a major or concentration; such students should contact the instructor in advance to guarantee placement in the course.

LING 210 Articulatory and Acoustic Phonetics (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
In this course, students will learn to recognize, produce, describe, transcribe, and analyze speech sounds from languages all over the world. We will explore the
basic physics behind the way we produce speech sounds, the acoustic properties of speech as a sound wave, and how these combine to create common patterns
across languages. Throughout the course, students will learn the International Phonetic Alphabet (a standardized system for phonetic transcription) and mathe-
matical and computer techniques for rigorous phonetic analysis.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, regular lab assignments, frequent quizzes, a midterm exam, and a final project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Preference given to students needing the course to satisfy prerequisites for future courses or to fulfill re-
quirements for a major or concentration; such students should contact the instructor in advance to guarantee placement in the course.

LING 220(S) The Syntactic Structure of English (Same as English 224) (W)
This course is an introduction to a rigorous, scientific approach to language study. No previous training in linguistics is assumed, and no reading is required for the
course. A better understanding of the underlying structure of English and of language in general will proceed by way of class discussion and homework problems.
These discussions and problems will involve students in observation and analysis of linguistic data through construction, testing, and revision of syntactic theo-
ries. The homework will require time and careful attention and will usually be rather challenging.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions and 30-40 pages of writing in the form of frequent essays.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR SANDERS
LING 230(F) Introduction to Logic and Semantics (Same as Philosophy 131) (Q)
This course is an introduction to both formal logic and the study of linguistic meaning. Throughout the course, a formal system of logic will be developed, and its
adequacy for describing linguistic meaning will be tested. Topics to be covered include the meaning of words and sentences, first-order predicate logic, logical
deduction, interpretation and understanding, and pragmatics.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, a midterm exam, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40). Preference given to students using the course to fulfill requirements for a major or concentration; such

LING 310(F) Phonology
Phonology is the study of sound patterns within and across languages. This course builds upon prior knowledge of phonetic description and requires familiarity
with the International Phonetic Alphabet. In this course, we will develop, question, and improve upon formal descriptions for the internal structure of sounds and
for the rules governing their systematic behavior. Specific topics to be covered include distinctive feature theory, phonemes, allophones, linear rules, rule ordering,
opacity, morphology, autosegmental phonology, and current trends in phonological theory.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, a midterm exam, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Linguistics 100 or Linguistics 210. No enrollment limit (expected: 10).

(See under PHIL 301 for full description.) MLADENOVIC
LING 340(S) Historical Linguistics
This course is an introduction to the study of how languages change over time. We will explore the regularity of sound change and how this can be exploited via
the comparative method to build viable hypotheses that reconstruct the pronunciations of ancient languages. From these reconstructions, we will classify lan-
guages into related families and uncover the limits of our ability to peer into the linguistic past. Though the primary focus of this course is on sound change,
syntactic and semantic change will also be covered.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, weekly homework, a midterm exam, and a final exam.
Prerequisites: Linguistics 100 or Linguistics 210. No enrollment limit (expected: 15).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF SANDERS
LING 360 Morphology (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This course provides an introduction to linguistic morphology, covering the major concepts of, theoretical approaches to, and current issues in the literature on
word-formation in human languages. Issues to be addressed include the nature of word-hood; inflection and derivation; "piece"-based vs. "process"-based ap-
proaches to morphology; paradigms; productivity; and the locus of morphology with respect to phonology and syntax. In addition to discussion of the above
theoretical issues, we will also be applying the principles of morphological analysis to actual linguistic data from English as well as various other languages from
around the world.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: participation in discussions, occasional homework, one or two midterm exams, an oral presentation, and a final proj-
ect.

In this course, students will pursue, present, discuss, and critique a significant research project on a topic in linguistics of their choice. Group discussions will
explore the larger issues of research methodology (including the collection and analysis of linguistic data) and the art and practice of presenting results: how to
give a conference talk, and how to write conference abstracts, presentation handouts, and research papers. While the focus of this seminar is specifically on
linguistics research, the broader issues of how to conduct and present high-level research are relevant to anyone in academia. The seminar will culminate in a
mini-conference open to the public in which the students will present a polished version of the research.
Format: seminar. Requirements: participation in discussions, regular presentations of ongoing research including a final public talk, and a final paper.

MARITIME STUDIES
Chair, Professor RNADH COX
Advisory Committee: Professor: ART*, COX. Assistant Professors: GILBERT, TING. Associate Deans: GERRY, TOOMAJIAN.
The oceans cover almost three-quarters of the globe, and understanding them is of increasing importance in this era of climate change, sea-level rise, fisheries
crises, and the internationalization of the high seas. We encourage students to investigate our WaterWorld from a variety of perspectives. Maritime Studies is an
interdisciplinary, cross-divisional program that examines the literature, history, policy issues, and science of the ocean. Candidates for the concentration in Mari-
time Studies must complete a minimum of seven courses: the interdisciplinary introductory course (Geosciences 104 Oceanography), four intermediate core
courses (at Williams-Mystic), an elective, and the senior seminar.
Students who have completed other study-away programs that emphasize marine studies should consult with the program chair about the possibility of com-
pleting the Maritime Studies concentration.
REQUIRED COURSES:

HONORS PROGRAM IN MARITIME STUDIES
Candidates for honors in Maritime Studies will complete a thesis in their senior year. The project will involve original research (archive, museum, field, or
laboratory) followed by on-campus analysis and writeup of results. This could be either a one-semester project, or a full year (two semesters plus winter study). In
either case, data collection during the summer before the senior year may be necessary. In some cases, the thesis project may be a continuation and expansion of
the student's Williams-Mystic research project. Honors will be awarded if the thesis shows a high degree of scholarship, originality, and intellectual insight.

MAJOR
The major in Mathematics is designed to meet two goals: to introduce some of the central ideas in a variety of areas of mathematics and statistics, and to
develop problem-solving ability by teaching students to combine creative thinking with rigorous reasoning.
Students are urged to consult with the department faculty on choosing courses appropriate to an individualized program of study.
REQUIREMENTS (nine courses plus colloquium)
Calculus (two courses)
Mathematics 104 Calculus II or an equivalent high school course
Mathematics 105 or 106 Multivariable Calculus
Except in unusual circumstances, students planning to major in mathematics should complete the calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104,
105/106) before the end of the sophomore year, at the latest.
Applied/Discrete Mathematics/Statistics (one course)
Mathematics 209 Differential Equations and Vector Calculus or
Mathematics 210 Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Physics 210) or
Mathematics 251 Discrete Mathematics or
Statistics 201 Statistics and Data Analysis or
Statistics 231 Statistical Design of Experiments or
a more advanced elective in discrete or applied mathematics or statistics, with prior departmental approval: Mathematics 305, 306, 315, 361, 375,
433, 452, or any Statistics course 300 or above or an appropriate course from another department as listed in the notes below.
Notes: Mathematics 251 is required in Computer Science, and Mathematics 209 is recommended in other sciences, but double majors should under-
stand that no course may count toward both majors.
Core Courses (three courses)
Mathematics 211 Linear Algebra
Mathematics 301 Real Analysis or Mathematics 305 Applied Real Analysis
Mathematics 312 Abstract Algebra or Mathematics 315 Groups and Characters or Mathematics 317 Applied Abstract Algebra
Completion (three courses plus colloquium)
The Senior Major Course is any 400-level course taken in the senior year. In exceptional circumstances, with the prior permission of the department, a
student may be allowed to satisfy the Senior Major Course requirement in the junior year, provided that the student has completed three 300-level
mathematics courses before enrolling in the Senior Major Course (if it is a statistics seminar, one of the 300-level courses may be replaced by Statistics
231).
Two electives from courses numbered 300 and above or Statistics 231.
Weekly participation as a senior in the Mathematics Colloquium, in which all senior majors present talks on mathematical or statistical topics of their
choice.
NOTES
In some cases, an appropriate course from another department may be substituted for one of the electives, with prior permission of the Mathematics and
Statistics Department. In any case, at least eight courses must be taken in mathematics and statistics at Williams. These can, with prior permission, include courses
taken away. Students with transfer credit should contact the department about special arrangements.
APPLIED MATHEMATICS OR OTHER SCIENCES
Students interested in applied mathematics or other sciences should consider Mathematics 209, 210, 251, 305, 306, 315, 323, 342, 354, 361, 433, or Statistics
201, 231, 346, 442, and additional appropriate courses from outside Mathematics and Statistics, including possibilities such as Chemistry 301, Computer Science
256, Computer Science 361, Economics 255, Physics 201, Physics 202, Physics 210 or more advanced physics courses. Students interested in economics should
consult the Economics Department.
BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Students interested in careers in business or finance should consider Mathematics 373, as well as courses in statistics and related areas such as Statistics 101,
201, 231, 331, 344, 346, 442, 443. Since these courses address different needs, students should consult with the instructors to determine which seem to be most
appropriate for individuals.
ENGINEERING
Students interested in engineering should consider the courses for applied mathematics immediately above, with Mathematics 209 and 305 especially recom-
mended. Williams has exchange and joint programs with good engineering schools. Interested students should consult the section on engineering near the begin-
ning of the Bulletin and the Williams pre-engineering advisor for further information.
GRADUATE SCHOOL IN MATHEMATICS
Students interested in continuing their study of mathematics in graduate school should take Mathematics 301 and 312. Mathematics 302 and 324 are strongly
recommended. Many of the 400-level courses would be useful, particularly ones that involve algebra and analysis. Honors theses are encouraged. Reading
knowledge of a foreign language (French, German, or Russian) is helpful.
STATISTICS AND ACTUARIAL SCIENCE
Students interested in statistics or actuarial science should consider Mathematics 341, Statistics 201, 331, 346, 442 and Economics 255. Additionally, students
should consider taking some number of the actuarial exams given by the Society of Actuaries, which can constitute part of an honors program in actuarial studies
(see section on honors below).
TEACHING
Students interested in teaching mathematics at the elementary or secondary school level should consider Mathematics 285, 313, 325, 381, Statistics 201 and
practice as a tutor or teaching assistant. Winter study courses that provide a teaching practicum are also highly recommended.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MATHEMATICS/STATISTICS
The degree with honors in Mathematics/Statistics is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstanding intellectual achievement in a program of study
which extends beyond the requirements of the major. The principal considerations for recommending a student for the degree with honors will be: Mastery of
core material and skills, breadth and, particularly, depth of knowledge beyond the core material, ability to pursue independent study of mathematics or statistics,
originality in methods of investigation, and, where appropriate, creativity in research.
An honors program normally consists of two semesters and a WSP (031) of independent research, culminating in a thesis and a presentation. Under certain
circumstances, the honors work can consist of coordinated study involving a regular course and one semester plus a WSP (030) of independent study, culminating
in a "minithesis" and a presentation. At least one semester should be in addition to the major requirements.
An honors program in actuarial studies requires significant achievement on four appropriate examinations of the Society of Actuaries and giving a second
colloquium talk. Written work is a possible component.
Highest honors will be reserved for the rare student who has displayed exceptional ability, achievement or originality. Such a student usually will have written a
thesis, or pursued actuarial honors and written a minithesis. An outstanding student who writes a minithesis, or pursues actuarial honors and writes a paper, might
also be considered.
Prospective honors students are urged to consult with their departmental advisor at the time of registration in the spring of the sophomore or at the beginning of
the junior year to arrange a program of study that could lead to the degree with honors. By the time of registration during spring of the junior year, the student must
have requested a faculty member to be honors advisor and must have obtained the department's approval of formal admission to the honors program. Such
approval depends on both the record and the promise of the applicant. It is conditional on continuing progress.
The recommendation for honors is usually announced at the end of the spring term. Participation in the honors program does not guarantee a recommendation
for honors. The decision is based not only on successful completion of the honors program but also on the merit of the student's overall record in mathematics. If
197
the student completes the program during the fall or winter study, the decision may be announced at the beginning of the spring term, conditional on continuing
merit.
ADVANCED PLACEMENT
The Mathematics and Statistics Department attempts to place each student who elects a mathematics course in that course best suited to the student's prepara-
tion and goals. The suggested placement in an appropriate calculus course is determined by the results of the Advanced Placement Examination (AB or BC) if the
student took one, and any additional available information. A student who receives a 3, 4, or 5 on the BC examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 106. A
student who receives a 4 or 5 on the AB examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 105. A student who receives a 1 or 2 on the BC examination or a 2 or 3
on the AB examination is ordinarily placed in Mathematics 104. Students who have had calculus in high school, whether or not they took the Advanced Place-
ment Examination, are barred from Mathematics 103 unless they obtain permission from the instructor. A student who receives a 4 or 5 on the Statistics AP
examination should consult the department for placement. In any event, students registering for mathematics and statistics courses are urged to consult with
members of the department concerning appropriate courses and placement. In general, students are encouraged to enroll in the most advanced course for which
they are qualified: it is much easier to drop back than to jump forward. The department reserves the right to refuse registration in any course for which the student
is determined to be over-prepared.
GENERAL REMARKS
Divisional Requirements
All mathematics and statistics courses may be used to satisfy the Division III requirement.
Alternate Year Courses
Core courses Mathematics 301, 305, 312, and 315 are normally offered every year. Other 300-level courses may be offered in alternate years. Senior seminars
(400-level courses) are normally offered every two to four years. Students should check with the department before planning far into the future.
Course Admission
Courses are normally open to all students meeting the prerequisites. Students with questions about the level at which courses are conducted are invited to
consult members of the department.
Course Descriptions
Descriptions of the courses in Statistics follow the descriptions of Mathematics courses.
Courses Open on a Pass/Fail Basis
Students taking a mathematics or statistics course on a pass/fail basis must meet all the requirements set for students taking the course on a graded basis.
With the permission of the department, any course offered by the department may be taken on a pass/fail basis. Permission will not be given to mathematics
majors to meet any of the requirements of the major or honors degree on this basis. However, with the permission of the department, courses taken in the depart-
ment beyond those requirements may be taken on a pass/fail basis.
Study Abroad
Programs like the "Budapest Semester in Mathematics" are recommended for majors who wish to focus on mathematics away. The department, though,
normally accommodates students who select other study away programs. Majors typically take their core courses (analysis and algebra) at Williams, and some-
times select courses away which (with prior approval) count as 300-level mathematics or statistics electives. The department offers its core courses in both the fall
and the spring to allow students to spend more easily a semester away.
Graduate School Requirements
An increasing number of graduate and professional schools require mathematics and statistics as a prerequisite to admission or to attaining their degree. Stu-
dents interested in graduate or professional training in business, medicine, economics, or psychology are advised to find out the requirements in those fields early
in their college careers.
MATHEMATICS COURSES
STATISTICS COURSE LISTINGS FOLLOW THE MATHEMATICS COURSE LISTINGS.
NOTE: Course Numbers--The first digit of the three-digit label for each course roughly denotes the difficulty level of the course. The
middle digit denotes the field (0=calculus/analysis, 1=algebra/number theory, 2=geometry/topology, 3=applied, 4=probability, 5=discrete,
6=computation, 7,8=miscellaneous). The last digit occasionally indicates the level within a field, but most often simply distinguishes
amongst the courses in the field. In particular, for example, Math 211 is not "easier" than Math 251; they are simply different mathe-
matical fields (algebra vs. discrete).
There are three types of 300-level courses. There are the core courses: Math 301, 305, 312, 315, 317. There are the "precore" courses,
which do not have the core courses as prerequisites. These include Math 313, 316, 327 and others. Finally there are those courses that
have a core course as a prerequisite, such as Math 302.
MATH 101T(F) Mathematical Analysis with Descriptive Statistics
This course is intended to develop quantitative skills for non-science majors. We will cover basic algebra from an applied point of view, including working with
formulas and solving for unknowns. We will investigate a variety of ways to model real-world problems. For example, how many handshakes away are you from
the president and how is that related to a transportation network? We will cover basic finance, including loans and annuities. Finally, we will also cover descriptive
statistics, including data analysis, computing with mean/median/variance, data display and contingency tables.
Format: tutorial/computer lab. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes and/or exams, and computer projects.
Prerequisites: placement by a Quantitative Studies Counselor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).
Tutorial meetings to be arranged. S. JOHNSON
MATH 102(F) Precalculus
This course prepares students for Mathematics 103, first semester calculus. The course begins with a brief review of algebra followed by a thorough treatment of
algebraic, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions from a graphical, analytical and applied point of view.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: placement by a Quantitative Studies Counselor or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: (expected: 15).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF O. BEAVER
MATH 103(F,S) Calculus I (Q)
Calculus permits the computation of velocities and other instantaneous rates of change by a limiting process called differentiation. The same process also solves
"max-min" problems: how to maximize profit or minimize pollution. A second limiting process, called integration, permits the computation of areas and accu-
mulations of income or medicines. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a useful and surprising link between the two processes. Subtopics include
trigonometry, exponential growth, and logarithms. This is an introductory course for students who have not seen calculus before. Students who have previously
taken a calculus course may not enroll in Mathematics 103 without the permission of instructor.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based primarily on homework, quizzes, and/or exams.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 102 (or demonstrated proficiency on a diagnostic test; see Mathematics 101). No enrollment limit (expected: 30).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF, 11:00-11:50 MWF First Semester: BEESON
9:55-11:10 TR Second Semester: BURGER
MATH 104(F,S) Calculus II (Q)
Mastery of calculus requires understanding how integration computes areas and business profit and acquiring a stock of techniques. Further methods solve equa-
tions involving derivatives ("differential equations") for population growth or pollution levels. Exponential and logarithmic functions and trigonometric and
inverse functions play an important role. This course is the right starting point for students who have seen derivatives, but not necessarily integrals, before. Stu-
dents who have received the equivalent of advanced placement of AB 4 or BC 3 may not enroll in Mathematics 104 without the permission of instructor. Students
who have higher advanced placement must enroll in Mathematics 105 or above.

MATH 106(F) Multivariable Calculus (Q)
Applications of calculus in mathematics, science, economics, psychology, the social sciences, involve several variables. This course extends calculus to several
variables: vectors, partial derivatives and multiple integrals. The goal of the course is Stokes Theorem, a deep and profound generalization of the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus. The difference between this course and Mathematics 105 is that Mathematics 105 covers infinite series instead of Stokes Theorem. Stu-
dents with the equivalent of BC 3 or higher should enroll in Mathematics 106, as well as students who have taken the equivalent of an integral calculus and who
have already been exposed to infinite series. For further clarification as to whether or not Mathematics 105 or Mathematics 106 is appropriate, please consult a
member of the math/stat department. Mathematics 106 satisfies any Mathematics 105 prerequisite. Credit will not be given for both Mathematics 105 and Mathe-

MATH 175 Mathematical Politics: Voting, Power, and Conflict (Same as INTR 160) (Not offered 2009-2010) (Q)
Who should have won the 2000 Presidential Election? Do any two senators really have equal power in passing legislation? How can marital assets be divided
fairly? While these questions are of interest to many social scientists, a mathematical perspective can offer a quantitative analysis of issues like these and more. In
this course, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various types of voting systems and show that, in fact, any such system is flawed. We will also
examine a quantitative definition of power and the principles behind fair division. Along the way, we will enhance the critical reasoning skills necessary to tackle
any type of problem mathematical or otherwise.

MATH 180(F) The Art of Mathematical Thinking: An Introduction to the Beauty and Power of Mathematical Ideas (Q)
What is mathematics? How can it enrich and improve your life? What do mathematicians think about and how do they go about tackling challenging questions?
Most people envision mathematicians as people who solve equations or perform arithmetic. In fact, mathematics is an artistic endeavor which requires both
imagination and creativity. In this course, we will experience what this is all about by discovering various beautiful branches of mathematics while learning life
lessons that will have a positive impact on our lives. There are two meta-goals for this course: (1) a better perspective into mathematics, and (2) sharper analytical
reasoning to solve problems (both mathematical and nonmathematical).

MATH 209(S) Differential Equations and Vector Calculus (Q)
Historically, much beautiful mathematics has arisen from attempts to explain heat flow, chemical reactions, biological processes, or magnetic fields. A few inge-
nious techniques solve a surprisingly large fraction of the associated ordinary and partial differential equations. The mystical Pythagorean fascination with ratios
and harmonics is vindicated and applied in Fourier series and integrals. Integrating vectorfields over surfaces applies equally to blood flow, gravity, and differen-
tial geometry.

MATH 211(F,S) Linear Algebra (Q)
Many social, political, economic, biological, and physical phenomena can be described, at least approximately, by linear relations. In the study of systems of
linear equations one may ask: When does a solution exist? When is it unique? How does one find it? How can one interpret it geometrically? This course develops
the theoretical structure underlying answers to these and other questions and includes the study of matrices, vector spaces, linear independence and bases, linear
transformations, determinants and inner products. Course work is balanced between theoretical and computational, with attention to improving mathematical
style and sophistication.

linear algebra, with an emphasis on its conceptual development and the beauty of its mathematical structure. There will be weekly assignments requiring clearly
written proofs of theorems and facts in linear algebra, and expecting the level of independent study of a tutorial. The topics to be covered are matrices, vector
spaces, linear independence, linear transformations, orthonormal bases, inner product spaces, and some applications such as fractals and linear regression.

The fundamental focus of this tutorial is for students to acquire the ability to create and clearly express mathematical arguments through an exploration of topics
from discrete mathematics. Students will learn various mathematical proof techniques while discovering such areas as logic, number theory, infinity, geometry,
graph theory, and probability. Our goal is not only to gain an understanding and appreciation of interesting and important areas of mathematics but also to develop
and critically analyze original mathematical ideas and argumentation. Note: this course fulfills the same requirements as does Mathematics 251 but credit will not
be given for both Mathematics 251T and Mathematics 251.

MATH 285(F) Teaching Mathematics (Q)
Under faculty supervision, student-teachers will prepare and conduct scheduled weekly extra sessions for Mathematics 105, for smaller, assigned groups of
students. For these sessions they will prepare presentations, assign and grade homework, and answer questions on the course material and on the homework.
199
They will be available to their students outside of class, attend and assist at Mathematics 105 lectures (3 hours a week), and visit and evaluate each other's
sessions. There is a weekly meeting, for an hour or two, including organizational matters, deeper study of the mathematics discussed, and practical teaching skills.
In addition, there will be other special meetings as needed. There will be assigned readings, discussion, drills, and weekly homework or papers. This is not a
seminar on education but rather a seminar on mathematics and the mechanics of teaching it.

MATH 301(F) Real Analysis (Q)
Real analysis is the theory behind calculus. It is based on a precise understanding of the real numbers, elementary topology, and limits. Topologically, nice sets are
either closed (contain their limit points) or open (complement closed). You also need limits to define continuity, derivatives, integrals, and to understand se-
quences of functions.

MATH 302 Complex Analysis (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
The calculus of complex-valued functions turns out to have unexpected simplicity and power. As an example of simplicity, every complex-differentiable function
is automatically infinitely differentiable. As examples of power, the so-called "residue calculus" permits the computation of "impossible" integrals, and "confor-
mal mapping" reduces physical problems on very general domains to problems on the round disc. The easiest proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, not
to mention the first proof of the Prime Number Theorem, used complex analysis.

MATH 303 Analytic Number Theory (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that every natural number beyond 1 is a product of prime numbers in a unique way, up to ordering. Analytic number
theory is an area of number theory that employs powerful ideas from analysis to discover beautiful structure within the set of primes. In this course, we will
investigate a number of elementary questions about arithmetic and the set of natural numbers. We will then move to the study of the distribution of prime numbers
and prove the amazing Prime Number Theory. In addition, we will consider other classical summits of the subject including the Riemann zeta function, Riesel
Numbers, Siepinski Numbers, Perfect Numbers, Carmichael Numbers as well as modern applications such as primality testing. We will also introduce some
powerful tools from complex analysis that are at the heart of the subject.

equations, optimal economic strategies, nonEuclidean geometry, and general relativity.

MATH 312(S) Abstract Algebra (Q)
Algebra gives us the tools to solve equations. Sets such as the integers or real numbers have special properties which make algebra work or not work according to
the circumstances. In this course, we generalize algebraic processes and the sets upon which they operate in order to better understand, theoretically, when equa-
tions can and cannot be solved. We define and study the abstract algebraic structures called groups, rings and fields, as well as the concepts of factor group,
quotient ring, homomorphism, isomorphism, and various types of field extensions.

MATH 313 Introduction to Number Theory (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
The study of numbers dates back thousands of years, and is fundamental in mathematics. In this course, we will investigate both classical and modern questions
about numbers. In particular, we will explore the integers, and examine issues involving primes., divisibility, and congruences. We will also look at the ideas of
number and prime in more general settings, and consider fascinating questions that are simple to understand, but can be quite difficult to answer.
Evaluation will be based primarily on performance on homework, projects, and exams.

The main goal of this tutorial is for students to discover some beautiful topics of number theory and their connections with geometry. Here we will explore how
the rational numbers sit within the real number line and how geometric observations lead to number theoretic insights. We will also introduce elliptic curves and
consider the fundamental algebraic issues surrounding them. Our objective is not only to develop an understanding and appreciation of interesting areas of num-
ber theory but also to create and critically analyze original mathematical ideas.

MATH 314T(S) Galois Theory and Modules (Q)
In the 1830's Evariste Galois developed a beautiful theory relating the structure of field extensions to the structure of a group. By understanding this relationship,
one can often translate a problem about field extensions to a question about groups that is easier to answer. In this course, we will study Galois Theory and
modules. A module is a generalization of vector spaces; in particular, a module can be thought of as a vector space with the weaker condition that the set of scalars
are elements of a ring instead of a field. Possible topics covered will include field theory, galois theory, quotient modules, direct sums, free modules, and exact
sequences.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based primarily on written homework, oral presentations, and exams.

MATH 314 Polynomial Arithmetic (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
Polynomials play an important role in mathematics, particularly in number theory. The desire to find solutions to polynomials over the integers led to the study of
numbers such as the square root of 2 and the cube root of 5. Polynomials themselves behave like integers in many ways. Although number theory is typically
thought of as the study of the integers, most number-theoretic questions about the integers can be reformulated in terms of polynomials. In fact, sometimes the
answers are much easier to discover for the polynomials. In this course, we will examine the arithmetic properties of polynomials over a finite field including the
200
analogy with the integers.

of theorems than to the more difficult proofs. Topics include symmetry groups, group structure (especially properties related to order), representations and charac-
ters over the real and complex fields, space groups (chemistry), matrix groups (physics).

Living in the early decades of the information age, we find ourselves depending more and more on codes that protect messages against either noise or eavesdrop-
ping. We begin this course by studying the history of this subject, including, for example, the story of the enigma code from World War II. We then examine some
of the most important codes currently being used to protect information, including linear codes, which in addition to being mathematically elegant are the most
practical codes for error correction, and the RSA public key cryptographic scheme, popular nowadays for internet applications. Looking ahead by a decade or
more, we show how a "quantum computer" could crack any RSA code in short order, and how quantum cryptographic devices will achieve security through the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
Evaluation will be based on homework sets and exams.

of this theory. Possible topics include cryptography, puzzles, error correcting codes, computer software applications, symmetry, tiling, networks, and grobner
bases.

tions and probability). The main goal of this tutorial is to learn how to use computers to do quantitative science. We will explore concepts and ideas in mathemat-

MATH 321 Knot Theory (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
Take a piece of string, tie a knot in it, and glue the ends together. The result is a knotted circle, known as a knot. For the last 100 years, mathematicians have studied
knots, asking such questions as, "Given a nasty tangled knot, how do you tell if it can be untangled without cutting it open?" Some of the most interesting
advances in knot theory have occurred in the last ten years.
This course is an introduction to the theory of knots. Among other topics, we will cover methods of knot tabulation, surfaces applied to knots, polynomials
associated to knots, and relationships between knot theory and chemistry and physics. In addition to learning the theory, we will look at open problems in the field.

MATH 322 Differential Geometry (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
It is easy to convince oneself that the shortest distance from equatorial Africa to equatorial South America is along the equator. This illustrates the fact that
"straight lines" on a sphere are described by so-called great circles. It is somewhat more difficult to describe the shortest path between two points on the surface of,
for example, a doughnut, reflecting the fact that a doughnut curves in space in a more complicated way than the sphere. Differential geometry is the mathematical
language describing these curvature properties. We will learn this language and use it to answer many interesting questions. For example, does it make sense to
talk about a sphere with an "imaginary" radius (it does), and what might the "straight lines" on such an object look like? Along the way, we will develop all of the
tools needed to begin the more advanced study of "Riemannian" geometry, which describes (among other things) Einstein's Relativity Theory. Topics: Curves in
space, the Frenet-Serret Theorem, (time permitting: the Fary-Milnor Theorem and the Isoperimetric Inequality), the first and second fundamental forms, geode-
sics, principal/Gaussian/mean/normal curvatures, the Theorema Egregium, the Gauss-Bonnet formula and Theorem, classification of closed and orientable sur-
faces, introduction to n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds/metrics/curvature, applications in hyperbolic 3-space.

MATH 323 Applied Topology (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
In topology, one studies properties of an object that are preserved under rubber-like deformations, where one is allowed to twist and pull, but one cannot tear or
glue. Hence a sphere is considered the same as a cube, but distinct from the surface of a doughnut. In recent years, topology has found applications in chemistry
(knotted DNA molecules), economics (stability theory), Geographic Information Systems, cosmology (the shape of the Universe), medicine (heart failure), ro-
botics and electric circuit design, just to name some of the fields that have been impacted. In this course, we will learn the basics of topology, including point-set
topology, geometric topology and algebraic topology, but all with the purpose of applying the theory to a broad array of fields.

MATH 324T Topology (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
Topology is the study of when one geometric object can be continuously deformed and twisted into another object. Determining when two objects are topologi-
cally the same is incredibly difficult and is still the subject of a tremendous amount of research, including current work on the Poincare Conjecture, one of the
million-dollar millennium-prize problems. The first part of the course on "Point-set Topology" establishes a framework based on "open sets" for studying conti-
nuity and compactness in very general spaces. The second part on "Homotopy Theory" develops refined methods for determining when objects are the same. We
will prove for example that you cannot twist a basketball into a doughnut.

The subject of computational geometry started just 25 years ago, and this course is designed to introduce its fundamental ideas. Our goal is to explore ``visualiza-
tion'' and ``shape'' in real world problems. We focus on both theoretic ideas (such as visibility, polyhedra, Voronoi diagrams, triangulations, motion) as well as
applications (such as cartography, origami, robotics, surface meshing, rigidity). This is a beautiful subject with a tremendous amount of active research and
numerous unsolved problems, relating powerful ideas from mathematics and computer science.

MATH 327T Tiling Theory (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
Since humankind first utilized stones and bricks to create floors, tiling has been a part of civilization. Practitioners include artists, engineers, designers, architects,
crystallographers, scientists and mathematicians. This course will be an investigation into the mathematical theory of tiling. We will focus on tilings of the plane,
including topics such as the symmetry groups of tilings, the topology of tilings, the ergodic theory of tilings, the classification of tilings and the aperiodic Penrose
tilings. We will be able to see how algebra can be utilized to solve a variety of tiling problems. We will also look at knotted tilings in higher dimensions. In addition
to several books on the subject, we will work from current research papers.

Many biological phenomena can best be examined through fairly sophisticated mathematical models. In particular, differential equation models have been used
to explain fluctuations in food webs, the spread of disease, consequences of certain fishing practices, immune system response to infection, spatial distribution of
species, formation of zebra stripes, and flux across cell membranes. We will introduce the mathematical machinery needed for these models, including the theory
of ordinary differential equations, phase portrait dynamics, and partial differential equations. We will establish the biological assumptions that go into these mod-
els and examine the consequent dynamics. Students will work in pairs covering material and explaining it to one another, presenting worked problems, and
critiquing each others presentations.

MATH 337(F) Electricity and Magnetism for Mathematicians (Q)
Maxwell's equations are four simple formulas, linking electricity and magnetism, that are among the most profound equations ever discovered. These equations
led to the prediction of radio waves, to the realization that a description of light is also contained in these equations and to the discovery of the special theory of
relativity. In fact, almost all current descriptions of the fundamental laws of the universe are deep generalizations of Maxwell's equations. Perhaps even more
surprising is that these equations and their generalizations have led to some of the most important mathematical discoveries (where there is no obvious physics) of
the last 25 years. For example, much of the math world was shocked at how these physics generalizations became one of the main tools in geometry from the
1980s until today. It seems that the mathematics behind Maxwell is endless. This will be an introduction to Maxwell's equations, from the perspective of a
mathematician.

MATH 355 The Art of Creating Mathematics (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
Here we will face challenging questions, conundrums, and conjectures from all areas of mathematics that lead to imaginative and creative thinking. This course
will bring together some of the seemingly disparate corners of students' mathematical backgrounds and offer mathematics as a unified suite of ideas that beauti-
fully hang together. Students will discover problem-solving techniques, sharpen their abilities to prove theorems, and develop a greater appreciation for various
corners of mathematics by exploring fundamental questions that illustrate key ideas. Students will not only be expected to produce original solutions to conun-
drums and proofs of theorems, but also to clearly articulate, both verbally and in written form, their ideas and analyses. The course will be driven by student
presentations and discussions.

This course will be a mathematical investigation of the idea of fairness. Who should have won the 2000 Presidential Election, and--more generally--what are
the best voting procedures to use when there are three or more candidates? How can marital assets be divided fairly, and how is this related to the resolution of
international disputes? We will use mathematics, including ideas from logic, analysis, and geometry, to answer questions like those above, arising in political
science and economics. In addition to several books on the subject, we will also read original mathematics research articles.

MATH 401(S) Functional Analysis with Applications to Mathematical Physics (Q)
Functional analysis can be viewed as linear algebra on infinite dimensional spaces. It is a beautiful area of mathematics which brings together and extends ideas
from analysis, algebra and geometry. Functional analysis also provides the rigorous mathematical background for several areas of theoretical physics (especially
quantum mechanics). We will introduce infinite-dimensional spaces (Banach and Hilbert spaces) and study their properties. These spaces are often spaces of
functions (for example, the space of square integrable functions). We will consider linear operators on Hilbert spaces and study their spectral properties. A special
attention will be dedicated to various operators arising from mathematical physics--especially the Schrdinger operator.

The study of measure theory arose from the study of stochastic (probabilistic) systems. Applications of measure theory lie in biology, chemistry, physics as well as
in economics. In this course, we develop the abstract concepts of measure theory and ground them in probability spaces. Included will be Lebesgue and Borel
measures, measurable functions (random variables). Lebesgue integration, distributions, independence, convergence and limit theorems. This material provides
good preparation for graduate studies in mathematics, statistics and economics.

MATH 403 Irrationality and Transcendence (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
The study of the nature of numbers is one of the most ancient and fundamental pursuits in all of mathematics. In this course we explore the worlds of irrational and
transcendental number theory. A number is algebraic if it is the solution to a nontrivial polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Numbers that are not
algebraic are called transcendental. While these issues are ancient, it was not until 1844 that it was shown that transcendental numbers exist. Since then many
modern techniques have been developed to shed some insight into these enigmatic numbers. These techniques beautifully weave ideas from algebra and analysis
together. Here we will provide all the necessary ideas from algebraic number theory and from complex analysis.

Ergodic theory studies the probabilistic behavior of dynamical systems as they evolve through time. This course will be an introduction to the basic notions in
ergodic theory. The course will start with an introduction to the necessary topics from measure theory: sigma-algebras, measurable sets and measurable trans-
formations. Then we will cover ergodic, weak mixing, mixing, and Bernoulli transformations, and transformations admitting and not admitting an invariant
measure. There will be an emphasis on specific examples such as group rotations, the binary odometer transformations, and rank-one constructions.

MATH 406 Analysis and Number Theory (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
Gauss said "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory the queen of mathematics"; in this class we shall meet some of her subjects. We will
discuss many of the most important questions in analytic and additive number theory, with an emphasis on techniques and open problems. Topics will range from
Goldbach's Problem and the Circle Method to the Riemann Zeta Function and Random Matrix Theory.
Other topics will be chosen by student interest, coming from sum and difference sets, Poissonian behavior, Benford's law, the dynamics of the 3x+1 map as well
as suggestions from the class. We will occasionally assume some advanced results for our investigations, though we will always try to supply heuristics and
motivate the material. No number theory background is assumed, and we will discuss whatever material we need from probability, statistics or Fourier analysis.

Commutative algebra has applications ranging from algebraic geometry to coding theory. For example, one can use commutative algebra to create error correct-
ing codes. It is perhaps most often used, however, to study curves and surfaces in different spaces. To understand these structures, one must study polynomial
rings over fields. This course will be an introduction to commutative algebra. Possible topics include polynomial rings, localizations, primary decomposition,
completions, and modules.

MATH 413 An Introduction to p-Adic Analysis (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
Almost your entire mathematical life has been spent on the real line and in real space working with real numbers. Some have dipped into complex numbers,
which are just the real numbers after you throw in i. Are these the only numbers that can be built from the rationals? The answer is no. There are entire parallel
universes of number that are totally unrelated to the real and complex numbers. Welcome to the world of p-adic analysis-where arithmetic replaces the tape
measure and numbers take on a whole new look. Here we will explore this new notion of number and discover its impact on arithmetic, geometry, and calculus. It
turns out that p-adic analysis not only dramatically simplifies many mathematical areas but also provides a powerful tool for analyzing number theoretic issues.

The relation of high school algebra to the abstraction of Mathematics 312 is not apparent, but Galois Theory shows the link. One goal of high school algebra is to
solve (find roots of) linear equations (ax + b = 0) and quadratic equations. By the sixteenth century, methods were found to solve third and fourth degree equations.
Here progress stopped until the early nineteenth century, when Abel and Galois showed that no such general method for finding roots of equations of degree
higher than four can exist. They needed totally new tools, which led to the mathematics of abstract algebra. The goal of Mathematics 414 is to develop through
linear algebra, the deep connection between roots of polynomials and finite groups.

Groups were first invented to study the patterns in geometric shapes. Most notably were the symmetry groups of the Platonic solids, such as the cube
and the dodecahedron. We extend and generalize these ideas to higher dimensional polytopes, leading to the beautiful world of reflection groups. By
discovering elegant ways of moving between the worlds of (theoretical) algebra and (visual) geometry, problems in one world can be solved using
techniques in another. Concrete geometric examples will continually motivate our ideas, as well as provide connections to topology, combinatorics,
and physics.

In this tutorial students will work in pairs to discover and develop the basic theory of Diophantine analysis. Specifically, we will begin with a careful investigation
of the real numbers and develop a theory as to how well we can approximate a real number by rational numbers that are, in some sense, not very complicated. This
theory leads to many avenues of investigation including such areas as continued fractions, geometry of numbers, simultaneous approximation, and generaliza-

MATH 417 Algebraic Error-Correcting Codes (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
In the modern world, transmission of information is vital. Many methods used to transmit data, however, are susceptible to outside influences that can cause
errors. For example, information sent via phone lines can be corrupted by lightening. Algebraic Error-Correcting Codes provide an elegant and efficient way of
dealing with these errors. This course will be an introduction to this topic. Although the mathematical tools for designing error-correcting codes (groups, rings,
fields, vector spaces) are studied in their own right, we will focus on the applications of these theoretical concepts to coding theory. The course will cover various
types of codes including repetition codes, parity check codes, linear codes, Hamming codes and generalized Reed-Solomon codes.

MATH 419(F) Algebraic Number Theory (Q)
We all know that integers can be factored into prime numbers and that this factorization is essentially unique. In more general settings, it often still makes sense to
factor numbers into "primes," but the factorization is not necessarily unique! This surprising fact was the downfall of Lam's attempted proof of Fermat's Last
Theorem in 1847. Although a valid proof was not discovered until over 150 years later, this error gave rise to a new branch of mathematics: algebraic number
theory. In this course, we will study factorization and other number-theoretic notions in more abstract algebraic settings, and we will see a beautiful interplay
between groups, rings, and fields.

Algebraic Geometry studies the geometry of polynomials and lies in the intersection of a tremendous amount of current mathematics, ranging from number
theory to robotics. This course will be an introduction, emphasizing curves in the plane. In particular, we will study conics and cubics (books are written about the
geometry of cubics; the depth of the ideas involved with cubics is amazing). Fundamental notions such as projective space, elliptic integrals, algebraic varieties,
genus of a curve, the Riemann-Roch theorem, and rational points will be introduced.

associated to the class of knots that can be deformed into one another. Physical knot theory has applications to DNA knotting, protein knotting, and synthetic
chemistry, among other areas. It investigates the curvature, torsion, stick index, superinvariants and other physically realized quantities associated to knots. In this
course, we will learn the requisite background from differential geometry and knot theory and apply it to understand knots from this essential viewpoint.

MATH 426 Hyperbolic 3-Manifolds (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
3-manifolds are objects that locally look 3-dimensional, the spatial universe being an excellent example. For the last 100 years, mathematicians have tried to
determine all the possible 3-manifolds and means for distinguishing between them. In 1978, William Thurston stated the Geometrization Conjecture, which
essentially says that any 3-manifold can be cut into pieces, each of which has one of eight geometries. The pieces with seven of the geometries have been com-
pletely determined. But the pieces that have hyperbolic geometry, the so-called hyperbolic 3-manifolds, remain unclassified. This is because here is where all the
action is, where the richest structure lies. Here is where geometry collides with topology. In this course, we will investigate hyperbolic 3-manifolds, from their
beginnings in 1978 to the current research going on today.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, oral presentation and exams.

MATH 433 Mathematical Modeling and Control Theory (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
Mathematical modeling is concerned with translating a natural phenomenon into a mathematical form. In this abstract form the underlying principles of the
phenomenon can be carefully examined and real-world behavior can be interpreted in terms of mathematical shapes. The models we investigate include feedback
phenomena, phase locked oscillators, multiple population dynamics, reaction-diffusion equations, shock waves, morphogenesis, and the spread of pollution,
forest fires, and diseases. Often the natural phenomenon has some aspect we can control--such as how much pollution, electric charge, or chemotherapeutic
agent we put into a river, circuit, or cancer patient. We will investigate how to operate such controls in order to achieve a specific goal or optimize some interpreta-
tion of performance. We will employ tools from the fields of differential equations and dynamical systems. The course is intended for students in the mathemati-
cal, physical, and chemical sciences, as well as for students who are seriously interested in the mathematical aspects of physiology, economics, geology, biology,
and environmental studies.

STATISTICS COURSES
STAT 101(F,S) Elementary Statistics and Data Analysis (Q)
It is nearly impossible to live in the world today without being inundated with data. Even the most popular newspapers feature statistics to catch the eye of the
passerby, and sports broadcasters overwhelm the listener with arcane statistics. How do we learn to recognize dishonest or even unintentionally distorted repre-
sentations of quantitative information? How are we to reconcile two medical studies with seemingly contradictory conclusions? How many observations do we
need in order to make a decision? It is the purpose of this course to develop an appreciation for and an understanding of the interpretation of data. We will become
familiar with the standard tools of statistical inference including the t-test, the analysis of variance, and regression, as well as exploratory data techniques. Applica-
tions will come from the real world that we all live in.

Statistics can be viewed as the art (science?) of turning data into information. Real world decision-making, whether in business or science is often based on data
and the perceived information it contains. Sherlock Holmes, when prematurely asked the merits of a case by Dr. Watson, snapped back, "Data, data, data! I can't
make bricks without clay." In this course, we will study the basic methods by which statisticians attempt to extract information from data. These will include
many of the standard tools of statistical inference such as the t-test, analysis of variance and linear regression as well as exploratory and graphical data analysis
techniques.

What does statistics have to do with designing and carrying out experiments? The answer is, surprisingly perhaps, a great deal. In this tutorial, we will study how
to design an experiment in order to obtain the most information from it in the fewest number of observations. The efficient design of experiments is important not
only in the sciences: it has been credited for helping Japanese industry achieve its success. The examples from this course will be primarily from the students area
of interest. Students will be paired by area of interest and previous statistical experience. The culmination of the course will be a project where each student
designs, carries out, analyzes, and presents an experiment of interest to him or her.

This course focuses on methods for analyzing categorical response data. In contrast to continuous data, categorical data consist of observations classified into two
or more categories. Traditional tools of statistical data analysis are not designed to handle such data and pose inappropriate assumptions. We will develop methods
specifically designed to address the discrete nature of the observations and consider applications to the social sciences (e.g., is there a gender difference in the
belief in life after death) the biological/medical sciences (e.g., does the probability of a severe side effects increase with the dosage of a drug) and economics. All
methods are extensions of traditional ANOVA and regression models to categorical data.

Music majors are strongly urged to take courses in at least one foreign language while at Williams.
Musicianship Skills
Music majors are strongly urged to maintain, refine and improve their musicianship skills, such as sight-singing, score reading, melodic and harmonic dicta-
tion, and keyboard proficiency, throughout their entire Williams career.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN MUSIC
Three routes provide the opportunity for honors or highest honors consideration in the Music major:
a. Composition: A Composition thesis must include one major work completed during the senior year, a portfolio of smaller works completed during the
junior and senior years, and a 10- to 15-page discussion of the student's work or analysis of a major 20th Century work.
b. Performance: A Performance thesis must include an honors recital given during the spring of the senior year and a 15- to 20-page discussion of one or
more of the works performed. The student's general performance career will also be considered in determining honors.
c. History, Theory and Analysis, or Ethnomusicology: A written Historical, Theoretical/Analytical, or Ethnomusicological thesis between 65 and 80 pages
in length and an oral presentation based on the thesis is required. A written thesis should offer new insights based on original research.
In order for a thesis proposal to be approved a student must have at least a 3.3 GPA in Music courses (this GPA must be maintained in order to receive honors),
and must have demonstrated outstanding ability and experience through coursework and performance in the proposed thesis area. Students are encouraged to
seek the advice of their potential thesis advisor early in the junior year and no later than the first month of the second semester. A 1 to 2 page proposal written in
consultation with the faculty advisor must be received by the Music chair by the end of spring break.
Honors candidates must enroll in Music 493(F)-W31-494(S) during their senior year. A student who is highly qualified for honors work, but is unable to
pursue a year-long project for compelling reasons, may petition the department for permission to pursue a WS/one-semester thesis. The standards for evaluating
such a thesis remain the same. Completed thesis is due by April 15.
LESSONS
Courses involving individual vocal or instrumental instruction involve extra fees which are subsidized by the department. (See Music 251-258 and Studies in
the Musical Art 325, 326, 427, 428). For further information check the Music Department webpage and contact the Department of Music.
STUDY ABROAD
Music majors considering study abroad should meet with the department chair well in advance in order to determine whether it will be possible to complete the
requirements for the major. Study abroad courses are not accepted as substitutes for the specific required major courses. However, they may qualify as electives
toward the major if approved by the department.

100-LEVEL COURSES
MUS 101(F) Listening to Music: An Introduction
Intended for non-major students with little or no formal training.
When you listen to music--on the radio, on your Ipod, at a concert--how much do you really hear? This course has two goals: to refine listening skills, thus
increasing the student's understanding and enjoyment of music, while at the same time providing a survey of the major composers and musical styles of the
Western classical repertory to be encountered in concert halls today. Students will be introduced to music from the Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern
periods, including works by composers such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, and Stravinsky. Genres to be covered include the symphony, chamber
music, opera, song, and choral music. Attendance at selected concerts on campus required.

Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on two quizzes, a midterm and final exam, and two concert reports.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 30). Preference given to first-years and sophomores.
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF HIRSCH
MUS 102(F) Fundamentals of Music (W)
This course seeks to define and describe the fundamental nature of music in Western society. Through a variety of exercises and projects, students will develop an
understanding of basic musical rudiments such as pitch, scales, triads, rhythm, meter, and notation materials that form the foundation of Western art and popular
musics. By the end of the course, students will have begun the study of basic four-part harmony. All theoretical concepts will be reinforced through the develop-
ment of appropriate active-performance skills, including sight-singing, dictation, and keyboard performance. In addition, students will explore various topics such
as philosophies of music (including aesthetics), music cognition and perception, popular musics, and acoustics, and their relationships to defining the "fundamen-
tals" of music. Students will be expected to complete weekly argumentative papers reacting to the various philosophical readings; as the semester progresses,
these reaction papers will increase in both length and depth, in preparation for a final project of each student's choice. Students will receive frequent and detailed
critiques (either in the form of written comments or verbal discussions) of each writing assignment.
Format: two weekly lectures. Evaluation will be based on written and performance quizzes, weekly reaction papers, and a final research project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 10). Preference given to students with music-reading proficiency and demonstrated performance experience.
Hour: 11:20-12:35 TR BODNER
MUS 103(F) Music Theory and Musicianship I
Music 103 and 104 are designed for potential majors and for students with strong instrumental or vocal backgrounds. Although there is no prerequisite for Music
103, students are expected to have some knowledge of musical rudiments, reading proficiency in at least one clef, and ideally have some comfort reading both
bass and treble clefs. A short diagnostic exam will be administered at the first class meeting of Music 103 to assess students' skills and background, and determine
if a student requires any additional remedial work to complement and fortify course work during the early weeks of the semester. Students with a strong back-
ground in music theory may take a placement exam during First Days to see whether they can pass out of one or both semesters. Music 103 and 104 are required
for the music major.
Music 103 presents the materials, structures and procedures of tonal music, with an emphasis on the harmonic and contrapuntal practice of the baroque and
classical periods (ca. 1650-1825).
Music 103 explores triadic harmony, voice leading, and counterpoint with an emphasis on the chorale style of J.S. Bach and his predecessors. Keyboard harmony
and figured bass exercises, sight singing, dictation, analysis of repertoire, written exercises and emulation projects will develop both an intellectual and an aural
understanding of music of the period. Projects include the harmonization of chorale melodies, the arrangement of classical period minuets and the composition of
a dice game minuet.
Format: lecture two days a week; a conference meeting one day a week; ear training/musicianship skills lab meeting twice a week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly written work, written and keyboard quizzes, and midyear and final projects. Must be taken as a graded course.
Enrollment limit: 24 (expected: 24). Preference to potential majors, and those with strongest musicianship skills.

MUS 104(S) Music Theory and Musicianship I
Music 104 continues the practical musicianship work of Music 103, while expanding the scope of harmonic topics to include seventh chords and chromatic
harmony. Music 104 further explores the transformation of chorale harmony in contrapuntal works of the eighteenth century. Projects include the composition
and performance of preludes, fugues and organ chorale preludes on baroque models.
Format: lecture two days a week; a conference meeting one day a week; ear training/keyboard skills lab meeting twice a week. Evaluation will be based on
weekly written work, written and keyboard quizzes, and midyear and final projects. Must be taken as a graded course.

NOTE: Prerequisites for Music 106 through 141
For each course, varying degrees of musical experience are necessary. Students may consult with the instructor or simply attend the first class meeting. (Suc-
cessful completion of Music 101 automatically qualifies the student for Music 106 through 141.)
MUS 106 Opera (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
An introduction to the history of opera, from the genre's birth c. 1600 to the present. At various points in its 400-year development, opera has been considered the
highest synthesis of the arts, a vehicle for the social elite, or a form of popular entertainment. Opera's position in European cultural history will be a primary focus
of our inquiry. We will also study the intriguing relationship between text and music, aspects of performance and production, and the artistic and social conven-
tions of the operatic world. The multidimensional nature of opera invites a variety of analytical and critical perspectives, including those of music analysis, literary
studies, feminist interpretations, and political and sociological approaches. Works to be considered include operas by Monteverdi, Lully, Charpentier, Handel,
Gluck, Mozart, Rossini, Donizetti, Verdi, Wagner, Bizet, Puccini, Strauss, Berg, Britten, and Glass. This course may involve a trip to the Metropolitan Opera.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on a midterm, a brief paper, an 8-page paper, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 35 (expected: 25).
W. A. SHEPPARD
MUS 108 The Concerto (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
More than any other instrumental genre in music, the concerto by its nature tells stories. As in opera, the concerto focuses on a protagonist, usually a single soloist;
the interest of the work lies in the dynamic musical interplay between that individual and the larger ensemble. This course will explore the development of the
concerto, from its origins in 17th-century Italy through the 20th century. We will focus on the musical means by which composers of the Baroque, Classical,
Romantic, and Modern periods, working in a wide variety of styles, created compelling musical narratives. We will also consider the cultural contexts within
which concerti are composed and performed, giving particular attention to the persona of the virtuoso as exemplified by such figures as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven,
Clara Schumann, Liszt, Paganini, Horowitz, and Marta Argerich. Works to be studied will include several concerti to be performed on campus by the Berkshire
Symphony with professional and student soloists.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on short quizzes and papers, a midterm and a final exam, and attendance and participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15).
BLOXAM
MUS 109 Symphony (Not offered 2009-2010)
A musical and cultural historical survey of music for the symphony orchestra as observed in the late-eighteenth through the twentieth century. Genres to be
explored include the symphony, concerto, tone poem, and concert overture, by composers such as Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Berlioz, Liszt, Brahms, Mahler,
Richard Strauss, Ravel, Bartok, Crumb, Hailstork, and Joan Tower. Emphasis on listening.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on two hour-exams or quizzes from listening assignments and readings, one short paper and a final exam.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).
MUS 110 Chamber Music (Not offered 2009-2010)
A musical and cultural historical survey of music for small instrumental ensembles from the early-eighteenth through the twentieth centuries. Defined for this
course as ensemble music for from three to eight players, we will consider string quartets, works for strings and piano, and examples of wind and brass chamber
music by Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Webern, Bartok, Beach, Hailstork and many others. Several live performances will be presented in class by
faculty and visiting chamber musicians.
Format: lecture, twice per week. Evaluation will be based on several listening quizzes or short exams, a paper based on research or listening, and a final exam
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 25).
MUS 111(S) Popular Music: Revolutions in the History of Rock
This course will trace the history of rock music from the 1950s to the present, focusing on those musicians who revolutionized the genre in various periods. Such
"revolutions" are discovered in the use of new sounds and musical forms, in the relationship between lyrics and musical setting, and in the conception of rock's
role in society. Three objectives will underpin our studies: to develop listening skills with music that one often hears, but perhaps rarely listens to intently; to
determine in what ways popular music can be interpreted as reflecting its cultural context; and to encounter the work of several of the more innovative musicians
in the history of rock. Finally we will interrogate our own activities by asking why the study of the "merely popular" should be pursued in a liberal arts education,
whether new approaches can be developed for this endeavor, and what makes music "popular."
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two tests, two papers, and a final exam.
No prerequisites or musical background assumed. Enrollment limit: 80 (expected: 80). Preference given to juniors and sophomores.

MUS 114 American Music (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This lecture and discussion course focuses on American music in its cultural context. Students will explore a range of issues concerning music's relation to
national and ethnic identity, historical events, societal conflicts, and philosophical, literary, and artistic movements. The class will study works from a variety of
musical traditions: e.g., Native American, religious, classical, patriotic, blues, jazz, folk, Broadway, rock, and rap.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, two short papers, a midterm exam, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Preference to students with demonstrated interest in American Studies or Music.
M. HIRSCH
MUS 115 Introduction to Twentieth-Century Music (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Twentieth-century Euro-American art music involved a persistent exploration of the limits of musical possibility. Encounters with this music often challenge our
ears and musical minds and require us to reconsider fundamental conceptions of music itself. Throughout the course, we will investigate in what ways the basic
elements of music (e.g., harmonic organization, rhythm, timbre, instrumentation and performance conventions) were extended and revolutionized. Topics and
styles to be discussed include: atonality, expressionism, twelve-tone techniques, neoclassicism, electronic and computer music, stochastic music, minimalism,
and neoromanticism. We will also consider the music of this century in relation to contemporary developments in the other arts and to popular musical styles. The
syllabus will include works by such composers as Debussy, Mahler, Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Webern, Bartk, Weill, Milhaud, Shostakovich, Ives, Copland,
Babbitt, Stockhausen, Messiaen, Boulez, Berio, Cage, Grecki, Glass, Gubaidulina, and Tower.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on two tests, two short papers, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12).
W. A. SHEPPARD
MUS 116 Music in Modernism (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
The synthesis of the arts was a primary pursuit of modernist composers, artists, choreographers, and writers. Seeking either to realize Wagner's "total work of art"
in the theater, or to uncover the more general correspondences celebrated by Baudelaire, modernists consistently looked beyond their own media. Collaborations
on works of "total theater" were common: Satie, Cocteau, Massine, Picasso; Brecht, Hindemith, Weill; Stravinsky, Nijinsky, Bakst; Claudel, Honegger, Rubins-
tein. Modernists explored new connections between music and color (Scriabin, Kandinsky), music and literature (Joyce, Mann), and music and dance (Duncan,
Graham). Occasionally, modernists attempted to unite the arts on their own: Schoenberg painted, Pound composed, and Kokoschka wrote. Our focus will be on
those works of music, art, dance, and literature that explored new relationships between the arts. One goal will be to investigate whether specific equivalents exist
between techniques of modernist painting, poetics, choreography, and composition. Aware of the risks and rewards of interdisciplinary study, we will attempt our
own theories of artistic synthesis. This course is designed to bring multiple perspectives to the study of music in modernism.
Format: discussion/lecture. Evaluation will be based on three papers (6, 8, and 12 pages in length) and on class participation. Drafts of two of these papers will be
required. Students will receive detailed comments on each paper, allowing them to build upon those comments in subsequent writing assignments.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10).
W. A. SHEPPARD
MUS 117 Mozart (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This course will examine the extraordinary life and musical genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Through guided listening, students will gain appreciation of
Mozart's classical compositional style and its timeless appeal. The class will explore Mozart's pivotal position as a musician in Viennese society; his strange
combination of bawdy behavior and sublime artistry; his relationship with his domineering father, as well as with Haydn, Beethoven, and Salieri; and the myths
about Mozart that have sprung up in the two centuries since his death.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, listening quizzes, two short papers, a midterm exam, and a final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12). Preference given to students with demonstrated interest in music.
M. HIRSCH
MUS 118 Bach (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Johann Sebastian Bach now enjoys the status of a cultural icon, transcending time and place. But who was Bach, and why do his musical creations continue to
fascinate us? This course offers an introduction to the life and music of this iconic composer. We will explore aspects of cultural context (such as the social milieu
in which Bach developed his art and the use and perception of his music by his contemporaries), as well develop our listening skills by exploring matters of purely
musical content (the styles and forms of his prodigious oeuvre). Both instrumental and vocal music will be surveyed, including the Brandenburg Concerti, the
Goldberg Variations, the Magnificat, and the B Minor Mass. The course will conclude with a consideration of Bach's legacy in the 19th and 20th centuries.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on 2 papers, a midterm, a final exam, and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected 20).
BLOXAM
MUS 120(F) Beethoven
This course provides an introduction to the life and music of Ludwig van Beethoven. The composer's difficult childhood, tragic loss of hearing, clandestine affair
with the "Immortal Beloved," tempestuous relationship with his suicidal nephew Karl--such biographical elements, together with the French Revolution and
emergence of Romanticism, will form the backdrop for our study of his titanic artistic struggles and monumental achievements. Students will listen to a broad
cross section of Beethoven's music, including piano sonatas, string quartets, symphonies, overtures, concertos, choral works, and opera. We will explore his ties
to Haydn, Mozart, and other composers, his fierce individualism, and his impact on later generations, subjects linked to notions of artistic genius and the sublime.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on listening quizzes, two papers, midterm and final exams, and class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Preference will be given to those with a demonstrated interest in music.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR M. HIRSCH
MUS 121 Brahms in Context (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
In popular culture, Johannes Brahms is known especially as the composer of a well-known lullaby, as a gruff-looking bearded figure, and as the last of "The Three
Bs" (the other two being Bach and Beethoven). Beneath the beard, however, Brahms (1833-97) was a complicated man whose personal challenges, along with
the rich social and cultural environments in which he worked, played important roles in shaping the diverse musical repertory he produced. This course is a broad
introduction to Brahms's life and works, with an emphasis on how the music relates to issues of biography, psychology, and trends in music history, aesthetics,
politics, religion, literature, and the visual arts. Students will be exposed to many of Brahms's most important works, including symphonies, concertos, chamber
works, piano pieces, songs, the famous German Requiem and, of course, the lullaby.
Evaluation will be based on two papers, a midterm and a final exam, and attendance and participation
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15).

MUS 122 African-American Music (Same as Africana Studies 122) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This course will survey the history of African-American music in the United States from its beginnings through the mid-twentieth century. Focus on the following
themes: the survival of Africanisms in African-American music, the relationship of African-American music in the U.S. to the music of Africa and the African
diaspora, the process of acculturation, and the sociological study of African-American music in the U.S.
There will be an emphasis on discussing music, listening to it, watching videotaped performances, and attending concerts of live music for which there will be
additional costs. Evaluation: two hour exams, final exam, and three concert reviews.
No prerequisites, but students without musical backgrounds must learn a vocabulary of terms for describing musical sound. Enrollment limit: 20. If more than 20

MUS 124 The Singing Voice: Mechanics, History and Meaning (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Why does an opera singer sound different from a rock singer? Why can't one convincingly sing in the style of the other? And why is the former granted a higher
status and the latter a wider audience? This course examines the physiological and acoustical properties of singing and explores the varieties of singing style and
209
function including Western classical, jazz, pop and gospel as well as less familiar approaches such as overtone singing, yodeling and belting. The historical
development of singing styles will be considered as will the meaning making of specific vocal qualities. Students will learn the basics of several singing styles.
Format: lecture/discussion and one 50-minute vocal lab. Evaluation will be based on two tests, two papers, and a final project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference will be given to Music majors and ensemble participants.
B. WELLS
MUS 125 Music Cultures of the World (Not offered 2009-2010)
A case-study approach to the music of selected areas including Africa, Native America, India, and Afro-America. Focus is on analyzing the concepts and
behaviors that shape musical sound in different music cultures.
No prior musical experience required, but students without musical backgrounds must learn a vocabulary of terms for describing musical sound. There will be an
emphasis on listening.

MUS 126(S) Musics of Asia (D)
This course offers an introduction to the great diversity of Asian music. Our survey will span from East Asia (China, Korea, and Japan) to Southeast Asia (Thai-
land and Indonesia) to the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia (Tibet and Afghanistan), to the Middle East (Iran and the Arabian peninsula), and will end with the
extension of Asian music across North Africa and into Eastern Europe. Within this broad survey, we will focus on selected and representative musical cultures
and genres. In each section of the course, aspects of cultural context (including music's function in religious life and its relationship to the other arts), will be
emphasized. While our focus will be on the traditional and classical musics of these cultures, we will also briefly consider the current musical scene. Encounters
with this music will include attendance at live performances when possible.
This course satisfies the EDI requirement by exploring how the diverse musical traditions of Asia are shaped by radically different religious beliefs and social
norms and by demonstrating how various Asian cultures can be understood through their musical traditions. Much of the music we will encounter presents
aesthetics and cultural norms that differ radically from mainstream Euro-American cultural practices. To engage with these traditions students must attempt to
place themselves within different cultural frameworks, to hear music that they may find shockingly foreign with a different set of ears.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on four tests and two papers.
No prerequisites; no musical experience necessary. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR W. A. SHEPPARD

This course surveys the history of jazz from its origins to the present. Emphasis is on the contributions of the major figures in jazz as seen against the backdrop of
their social milieu. Emphasis on the relationship between music and the social experience of African Americans and the participation of white Americans and
Asian Americans in jazz.
This course includes an optional experiential education component whereby a limited number of students with substantial musical experience may audition for
the Zambezi Marimba Band and perform jazz and other music with this group in lieu of taking the final exam.
Format: lecture with some discussion. Evaluations based on the following: midterm exam, final exam (or limited optional participation in Zambezi), two concert
reviews, one research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 25). Preference given to jazz musicians and seniors.

MUS 131 Gender, Class, and Race in Western Musical Society (Not offered 2009-2010)
This course examines some of the myriad ways in which gender, class, and race have impacted both classical and popular music in the West. We will read a range
of current scholarship demonstrating contrasting philosophical, analytical, and critical approaches to studying the social history of music, and explore selected
topics focusing on certain composers, performers, and/or repertories germane to the subject. Topics may include, among other things, a comparison of the life and
works of Clara and Robert Schumann, the life and music of the Blues queens in the early twentieth century, Bizet's opera Carmen, Schubert and Tchaikovsky as
gay composers, and Madonna.
Format: lecture/discussion, twice per week. Evaluation will be based on class participation, several short papers, and a final project.

MUS 132 Women and Music (Not offered 2009-2010)
This course will introduce students to various issues concerning women in music (classical and popular): e.g., the widespread perception that there are no "great"
female composers, the claim that there is a "women's sound" in music, the representation of women in music by men, the gendered understanding of musical
forms, genres, and techniques, the historical spheres of women's music-making, and the challenges faced by female musicians in various social contexts from the
Middle Ages to the present. The class will explore women's contributions to music as composers, performers, teachers, patrons, and scholars.

MUS 133 Men, Women, and Pianos (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This course takes the piano, its repertory, and its performers as focal points for a social history of Western music, treating the piano as a locus around which issues
of gender, class and race are played out in nineteenth century and twentieth century musical life. In addition to exploring "serious" works by composers such as
Mozart and Beethoven, we will consider parlor music and music by crowd-pleasing virtuosi such as Liszt and Gottschalk. We will also consider a broad range of
classical and popular performers, ranging from Clara Schumann, Vladimir Horowitz, Artur Rubinstein and Glenn Gould through Art Tatum and Liberace. Other
topics will include the "cult of the virtuoso," Jane Campion's 1993 film The Piano, and musical nationalism as reflected in music for the piano.
Format: lecture/discussion. Two meetings per week. Evaluation based on participation, several short papers and quizzes, and a final project.

MUS 134 Myth in Music (Same as Comparative Literature 134) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
Orpheus, Prometheus, Faust, and Don Juan--these figures have captured the imagination of writers, artists, and composers throughout history. This course ex-
plores how prominent myths of western civilization have found expression in a broad variety of musical works, e.g., operas by Claudio Monteverdi, Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart, Hector Berlioz, Jacques Offenbach, and Carl Orff; songs by Johann Friedrich Reichardt, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, and Hugo Wolf;
ballets by Ludwig van Beethoven and Igor Stravinsky; symphonic poems by Franz Liszt and Richard Strauss; Broadway musicals by Richard Adler (Damn
Yankees, 1955), John Maxwell Taylor (Faustorama, 1993), and Randy Newman (Faust, 1993); and mixed-media projects by Libby Larsen (Frankenstein, or the
Modern Prometheus, 1990), Manfred Stahnke (Orpheus Kristall, 2001), and Rinde Eckert (Orpheus X, 2006). In studying such works, we will probe an array of
questions, including: Why have certain myths proven especially appealing to composers? What accounts for their musical longevity? How have myths been
adapted to different musical genres and styles, and for what purpose(s)? How do the works reflect the historical cultures in which they originated? How have they
engaged with different social, political, artistic, and intellectual concerns?
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, three 7- to 8-page papers (with revisions), and a final presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10). Preference given to students with a demonstrated interest in literature or music.

MUS 135 Storytelling in Music (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Many of the songs we hear on the radio derive their appeal, in part, from the interest of the narratives conveyed by their lyrics. Even without lyrics, however,
music itself can compellingly depict characters, emotions, settings, or events in order to relate tales of love, tragic loss, conflict, heroism and victory, transcen-
dence, comedy, adventure, and the exotic. This course explores the various musical means through which composers of the past several centuries have sought to
convey such stories in both texted and untexted genres including the sixteenth-century madrigal; opera; the concerto and the symphony; nineteenth-century song
cycles, solo piano works, and tone-poems; ballet and film scores; and jazz and rock 'n roll.
Evaluation will be based on brief written assignments and a paper, a midterm and a final exam, and attendance and participation.

MUS 136(S) Bach and Handel: Their Music in High Baroque Culture
This course compares and contrasts the lives and music of the two composers of the High Baroque who best capture the period's expressive aims, Johann Sebas-
tian Bach and George Frideric Handel. We will examine their contrasting life experiences and musical pursuits within the larger social and cultural framework of
210
the period: Bach as a provincial composer, servant to minor German aristocrats and the Lutheran Church, virtuoso organist and pedagogue; Handel as a cosmo-
politan celebrity and entrepreneur, creator of operatic and instrumental entertainments for both the Italian and English nobility and the paying public. Bach's
Brandenburg Concerti and B-minor Mass, and Handel's Water Music and Messiah are just a few of the works to be explored and enjoyed.

This course provides an introduction to the great variety of music in Europe before the Protestant Reformation. Important cities, courts and cathedrals of medieval
and Renaissance Europe will serve as focal points for situating a broad range of early music in its cultural context. We will explore innovations in sacred music at
cathedrals such as Rome, Paris, Reims, Florence, Bruges, and Salisbury, and trace the rise of secular music for the entertainment and empowerment of the French,
Burgundian, English, Imperial, and Italian courts. We will also consider the roles of music and musicians in the civic life of urban centers including Florence,
Paris, Bruges, and London. Genres of music to be addressed include plainchant, music for the Mass, ceremonial and devotional motets, vernacular song in
French, English, German and Italian, instrumental dance music, and early keyboard music. Composers will range from the 12th century abbess Hildegard of
Bingen through Leonin at Notre Dame of Paris c.1200, Machaut in 14th-century Reims, Dunstable in 15th century London, Du Fay in 15th century Florence,

MUS 138 Sibyl of the Rhine: The Life and Times of Hildegard of Bingen (Not offered 2009-2010)
The 11th century German abbess Hildegard of Bingen was one of the most remarkable people of her age. She was a theologian and reformer, poet, composer,
artist, author of treatises on natural science and medicine; she corresponded with emperors, kings, queens and popes as well as abbots, abbesses, nuns, monks, and
laypeople. Yet she lived most of her long life in a remote cloister on the banks of the river Rhine, and was virtually lost to history until her recent rediscovery 900
years after her birth. This course draws on a wealth of recent scholarship to explore the life and times of this extraordinary woman, using her music as the window
into her ideas and her world. Class meetings will include discussion of readings by and about her life and work as well as in-class performance of her plainsongs
and liturgical drama.

MUS 210T American Pop Orientalism (Not offered 2009-2010) (W) (D)
This tutorial will investigate the representation of Asians and Asian Americans in American popular culture since the late nineteenth century. Our focus will be on
music's role in Orientalist representation in a wide variety of media, including Hollywood film, television, popular song, Broadway musicals, and novels. We will
begin with major texts in cultural theory (Said, Bhabha) and will attempt throughout the semester to revise and refine their tenets. Can American Orientalism be
distinguished in any fundamental way from nineteenth-century European imperialist thought? How does Orientalist representation calibrate when the "exotic
others" being represented are themselves Americans? Our own critical thought will be sharpened through analysis and interpretation of specific works, such as
211
Madame Butterfly, "Chinatown, My Chinatown," The King and I, Sayonara, Flower Drum Song, Miss Saigon, Rising Sun, M. Butterfly, Aladdin, and Weezer's
Pinkerton. We will end the semester by considering the current state of Orientalism in American popular culture.
This course satisfies the EDI requirement by considering diversity in relation to the representation of specific minority groups within American popular culture
and the attempts by members of those minority groups to participate in mainstream culture. We will also engage with critical theories offered by scholars for
understanding the dynamics of these representations and this cultural participation.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on five 5- to 6-page essays and on the quality of the student's critical engagement with the work of his/her colleagues.
Previous related coursework and/or musical experience is desirable, but is not required. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected:10). Preference to sophomores and jun-

MUS 233 African Music: Interdisciplinary Studies (Same as Africana Studies 250 and INTR 287) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered
2010-2011)
This course examines African music from an interdisciplinary perspective that may include musical, historical, religious, sociological, dance, or psychological
studies. It also integrates music (or dance) performance with academic study. The goals of the course are to understand the synergy amongst music, dance, and
religion in Africa and its diaspora and to integrate academic study with the performance of music and dance. Themes and geographical focus may change from
year to year, and the course may be taken more than once.
In 2007-08 we will explore two case studies comparing and/or contrasting religious music and dance in Zimbabwe and Ghana. Students will meet for class
discussions during academic class hours as well as participate in separate labs/rehearsals and concerts with the Zambezi Marimba Band. Concert dates TBA.
Students will participate in two kinds of performance activities: 1) the opportunity to sing, play mbira dza vadzimu (the mbira of the ancestor spirits), marimba,
and hosho (rattle) with Cosmas Magaya and Beauler Shirto who are masters of Zimbabwean mbira music. The opportunity to dance Zimbabwean religious
music may be possible; 2) The opportunity to learn to play gyil (Ghanaian xylophone) and drums. The opportunity to dance to gyil music may be possible.
Evaluation will be based on papers, participation, and the improvement of performance skills. No exams.

MUS 234(F) Afro-Pop: Urban African Dance Music (Same as Africana Studies 234)
Over the past 100 years, West African highlife, Congolese rumba, and South African jazz and other urban musics have arisen all over the African continent. More
recently, rap has taken root, changing the musical landscape in Africa's cities. Although these urban musics are entertaining, they have a deeper significance. They
help Africans retain a link to tradition while recognizing the impact of urbanization, globalization, and other modern influences on lives of people in contempo-
rary Africa. We will examine several styles of urban dance music and the multiplicity of meanings these musics may carry through reading texts, watching videos,
and learning to perform music from Zimbabwe and Ghana with Forward Kwenda, Bernard Woma, and Ernest Brown.
Format: seminar and rehearsal/performance. Requirements: three 5- to 7-page papers and related oral presentations, attendance and participation in class and lab
(rehearsals with the Zambezi Marimba Band TR 4-6:30 PM and some weekends), participation in a concert of mbira music with Forward Kwenda on Nov. 7,

MUS 235 African Rhythm, African Sensibility (Same as Africana Studies 235) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (D)
This course has three goals. The first is to immerse students in African music, encouraging them to learn to play and understand this music from an insider's
perspective. The second goal is to deepen that understanding by introducing students to the work of scholars who have contributed to a theoretical understanding
of African music. The final goal is to broaden that understanding by comparing and contrasting certain features of African music with comparable ones in Euro-
pean and African-American musical traditions.
The course will investigate these topics through class discussions, papers, and reading, listening, and viewing assignments. Students will be musically immersed
in African music through their participation in labs/rehearsals with the Zambezi Marimba Band (Tuesdays and Thursdays 4-6:30 PM) where they will learn to
perform Zimbabwean marimba and mbira music with Prof. Brown and with Cosmas Magaya and Beauler Dyoko, masters of the Zimbabwean mbira dza vadzi-
mu (the mbira of the ancestor spirits). This material will be performed in a concert with Kusika and the Zambezi Marimba Band on a date to be announced. Other
African, African-American, and European music will be discussed, analyzed, or performed informally in class.
This course fits the Educational Diversity Initiative in that it immerses students in another culture and gives them the tools with which to understand that culture
from the inside. It also encourages students to reflect critically upon their insider's perspective and to develop a more theoretical understanding of that perspective.
Finally, this course fits EDI's emphasis on the Comparative Study of Cultures and Societies by encouraging students to compare and contrast specific aspects of
African and non-African music cultures.
Format: discussion/performance. Evaluation: performance 30%; participation in class 20%; papers 50%.
Prerequisites: an intermediate level of performance ability in music or dance. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). If more than 10 students register for the course,
selection will be by audition and writing sample

MUS 241(F) Introduction to the Music of John Coltrane (W)
This course offers the serious music student an opportunity to study the unique body of work produced by saxophonist and composer John Coltrane (1926-1967).
The course traces the evolution of Coltrane's compositional and performance styles in the context of the musical and cultural environment in which they devel-
213
oped. Emphasis placed on Coltrane's musical style, representing a unique synthesis of influences, including jazz, world, and European Classical music and spiri-
tuality. Substantial reading assignments, including a biography and related criticism, as well as detailed score analysis and study, are required.
Format: lecture. Evaluation based on in-class participation and preparation, quizzes on assigned readings, midterm and final examinations, participation in an
in-class group analysis presentation, and a final paper involving musical analysis of a Coltrane composition or recorded performance.
Prerequisite(s): Music 103 and/or 212 strongly recommended. Musical literacy sufficient to deal with the material and /or permission of the instructor. Enrollment
limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to Music students.

MUS 244T(S) Music and Meaning (W)
Nearly everyone finds music meaningful, but what exactly does it mean? Without the help of words, this largely non-referential art presents special challenges to
interpretation. While most would agree that musical sounds can do such things as mimic the rumbling of thunder, evoke the countryside, suggest the act of
chasing, or express rage, the capacity of music to convey meaning remains controversial among scholars, performers, and listeners. Some, following music critic
Eduard Hanslick, assert that musical works are essentially "tonally moving forms"--patterns of sound with no reference to the world outside themselves; a
work's meaning derives solely from the interplay of musical elements. Others counter that music can signify aspects of human experience, its sounds and struc-
tures not merely referring to the outside world but even relating complex narratives. Certain writers have argued that, without the assistance of language, what
music signifies remains vague, while others insist that the meaning of music is actually more precise than that of words. In this tutorial course, we will explore a
range of questions regarding musical meaning. How can combinations of pitches, rhythms, and instrumental timbres signify something beyond themselves? Is
the subject of musical meaning more relevant to some historical styles or genres than others? How can we glean the meaning(s) of a work? Should we concentrate
on formal processes within the music? Consider socially constructed meanings? Seek the composer's intentions? What makes some interpretations more con-
vincing than others? In grappling with these questions, students will engage with writings by Adorno, Agawu, Cone, Cook, Kramer, McClary, and Newcomb.
Music to be studied includes works by Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Brahms, Mahler, Tchaikovsky, Ravel, Stravinsky, Glass, and Adams.
Format: tutorial. During the first and last weeks of the semester, students will attend two group classes. In the other weeks, students will meet with the instructor in
pairs for a one-hour session. Students will write and present a 5- to 6-page paper every other week and a 1-2 page response to their partner's paper in the alternate
weeks. Evaluation will be based on five papers/presentations, and five responses.
Prerequisites: ability to read music, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores and juniors.

MUS 245T Music Analysis: Music with Text (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
The course explores the ways in which musical structure interacts with, can comment upon, and can influence one's reading of a text set to music, and similarly,
how texts set to music can exert influence upon and guide one's understanding of the musical structure. Using scenes from Mozart operas and selected songs of
the 19th and 20th centuries (by Schubert, Schumann, Brahms and Schoenberg), the course will examine the bearing specific aspects of a text (voice, person, time,
alliteration, meter, and so forth) have upon the musical domain, and conversely, how musical structures have the ability to project or allegorize actions in the text.
We will observe the often amazing ways composers of texted music use the tonal system to create musical desires--desires that may be fulfilled, withheld,
delayed, redirected, and so forth, in ways that enhance, or enact the desires of characters in a drama or poem. In addition to the specific issues involving texted and
dramatic works, the course will introduce certain techniques and insights of linear analysis--one of the most profound developments in tonal analysis during the
last century. Analysis assignments, based on the student's close study of texted musical works, will offer the opportunity to apply these techniques. The course
will also confront the difficult issue of writing about music and will help students define and clearly express ideas about music.
Format: tutorial. Students will attend one weekly group lecture and one weekly tutorial meeting. Grades will be based on five analysis essays/presentations and
five critiques of another student's analyses.
Prerequisites: Music 104. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference to those with the most theory background (Music 103/104, 201/202).

MUS 246T(F) The Tale of Carmen, 1845-Now (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 248T) (W)
The story of the gypsy femme fatale Carmen has endured for over 150 years. In Western culture she exemplifies the seductive, exotic, independent and forbidden
female who drives an upstanding man to a life of crime and finally murder. This course explores a broad array of treatments of this archetypal narrative, starting
with Prosper Mrime's 1845 novella on which Bizet based his beloved 1875 opera Carmen. We will consider various staged and film versions of the opera itself,
including Francesco Rosi's stunning 1984 movie, and discuss various other film transformations of the story, from DeMille's 1915 silent film through Hammers-
tein's 1954 all-black musical Carmen Jones, to the MTV version A Hip Hopera of 2004. Comic approaches will also be assessed, from Charlie Chaplin's Carmen
Burlesque of 1915 through Spike Jones' 1952 Carmen Murdered! and The Naked Carmen of 1970. We will analyze re-castings of Bizet's famous score in
instrumental music since 1875, and explore remarkable dance interpretations ranging from Carlos Saura's 1983 flamenco version through David Bourne's chore-
ography in his 2001 gay reading called The Car Man. Our ultimate purpose will be to probe the ways in which this powerful narrative and the music it inspired
have lent themselves to multifaceted textual and musical constructions of individual and group identities, encompassing gender and sexuality, "Otherness," na-
tionality, ethnicity, and class.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: After initial group meetings to discuss Mrime's novella and Bizet's music, students will meet with the instructor in pairs for one
hour each week. Each student will write a 5- to 6-page essay every other week (five in all), and provide peer reviews in alternate weeks. Evaluation will be based
on the quality of written work, discussions, and oral presentation.
No prerequisites; ability to read music useful but not necessary. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference to sophomores and juniors.

300-LEVEL COURSES
MUS 301(S) Introduction to Counterpoint
Counterpoint, the study of the ways independent melodic lines can be joined in music, has been essential to musical and compositional instruction for centuries.
Counterpoint was taught by Mozart, studied by Beethoven, and to this day remains an integral part of compositional training. The course will introduce students
to species counterpoint in two and three voices--exercises that develop discipline in polyphonic writing, hearing, and thinking-and will illustrate how such con-
trapuntal discipline is manifest in music from Palestrina and Bach to Brahms and Debussy. The species exercises will lead to a final composition project, such as
emulation of a motet in sixteenth-century style or a fugue.
Evaluation will be based on written exercises and emulation projects.
Prerequisites: Music 103 or permission of instructor.
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF E. GOLLIN

MUS 310(F) Brazilian and Latin Jazz: Theory, Analysis and Performance (Same as Africana Studies 310)
Brazilian and Latin Jazz have long had an influence on the development of jazz in the United States. From Dizzy Gillespie's famed collaborations with Chano
Pozo, the Bossa Nova craze of the 1960's to current artists like Danilo Perez, David Sanchez and Trio da Paz the rhythms of Brazil and Latin-America seem
almost as common as the original North-American "swing." We will analyze and perform repertoire from artists famous in the United States as well as traditional
music from Brazil, Cuba and South America expanding our knowledge of jazz theory with rhythmic, harmonic and melodic practices from these countries.
Format: There will be three meetings a week including one lab for rehearsal. The other two meetings will be a combination of lecture/discussion/analysis and
practical application with instruments. Requirements: There will be weekly written assignments including analyses, transcriptions and arrangements, occasional
quizzes and a mid-term examination. The final public concert will be an important factor in the grading process.

MUS 402(S) Senior Seminar in Music: Bach's Legacy (W)
This seminar, the culminating course in the music major, examines how composers after Bach have engaged and responded to his legacy. We will trace the course
of the Classical and early Romantic period "Bach Revival" through Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn, and explore how he was venerated in the later Roman-
tic era by Brahms and Busoni. Our main focus, however, will be on how composers of the modern era have viewed him and used his music. We will explore the
pertinence of Harold Bloom's theory of the "anxiety of influence" for understanding the ways in which contemporary classical composers ranging from Schoen-
berg and Webern through Peter Maxwell Davies and George Crumb engage Bach's music, and consider both the musical techniques and meanings of reworkings
and quotations of Bach's music in jazz and popular styles.

Neuroscience is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field concerned with understanding the relationship between brain, mind, and behavior. The interdisciplin-
ary nature of the field is apparent when surveying those who call themselves neuroscientists. Among these are anatomists, physiologists, chemists, psychologists,
philosophers, molecular biologists, computer scientists, linguists, and ethologists. The areas that neuroscience addresses are equally diverse and range from phys-
iological and molecular studies of single neurons, to investigations of how systems of neurons produce phenomena such as vision and movement, to the study of
the neural basis of complex cognitive phenomena such as memory, language, and consciousness. Applications of neuroscience research are rapidly growing and
include the development of drugs to treat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, the use of noninvasive techniques for
imaging the human brain such as PET scans and MRI, and the development of methods for repair of the damaged human brain such as the use of brain explants.
Combining this wide range of approaches and research methods to study a single remarkably complex organ--the brain--requires a unique interdisciplinary
approach. The Neuroscience Program is designed to provide students with the opportunity to explore this approach.
THE PROGRAM
The program in neuroscience consists of five courses including an introductory course, three electives, and a senior course. In addition, students are required to
take two courses, Biology 101 and Psychology 101, as part of the program.
Neuroscience (Neuroscience 201) is the basic course and provides the background for other neuroscience courses. Ideally, this will be taken in the sophomore
year. Either Biology 101 or Psychology 101 serves as the prerequisite. Electives are designed to provide in-depth coverage including laboratory experience in
specific areas of neuroscience. At least one elective course is required in Biology (Group A) and one in Psychology (Group B). The third elective course may also
come from Group A or Group B, or may be selected from other neuroscience related courses upon approval of the advisory committee. Topics in Neuroscience
(Neuroscience 401) is designed to provide an integrative culminating experience. Students take this course in the senior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN NEUROSCIENCE
The degree with honors in Neuroscience provides students with the opportunity to undertake an original research project under the supervision of one or more
of the Neuroscience faculty. In addition to completing the requirements of the Neuroscience Program, candidates for an honors degree must enroll in Neurosci-
ence 493-W31-494 and write a thesis based on an original research project. Presentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree
with honors. Students interested in pursuing a degree with honors should contact the Neuroscience Advisory Committee in the spring of their junior year.

The Performance Studies Program provides an opportunity to inhabit an intellectual place where the making of artistic and cultural meaning intersects with
critical reflection on those processes. The program has as its primary goal the bringing together of those students and faculty engaged in the creative arts, i.e.,
studio art, creative writing, dance, film and video, music, and theater with those departments that reflect in part on those activities, e.g., Anthropology and Sociol-
ogy, Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature, English, History, Music, Philosophy, Psychology, Legal Studies, Religion and Theatre. Central concepts and
interactions to Performance Studies are: action, the body, presence, ritual, representation, race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, politics, history and transcultural expe-
rience.
Performance Studies strongly suggests that interested students take the introductory course (LATS 230) and two of several recommended upper-level courses
(AFR 305, AFR 400, ARTH 408, ARTH 461, LATS 375, WNY 310, or WNY 311).
Currently, the Program's status is as a program without a concentration. However, students can petition and obtain a Performance Studies Contract Mayor.
Students are encouraged to do five things: 1) take the introductory course, which in 2009-10 is (LATS 230) Approaching Performance Studies; 2) take two
advanced courses which utilizes critical theory in relation to performance, such as (AFR 305) The Hip-Hop Generation; LATS (LATS 330) The Aesthetics of
Resistance; (LATS 375) Performance and Its Traces; (WNY 310) Art, Space and the City; (WNY 311) Imagining New York City; (AFR 400) Race, Gender,
Space; (ARTH 408) Contemporary Performance Art History: Space, Time, Action; (ARTH 461) Writing About Bodies; 3) try different artistic media, both in the
curriculum and beyond; 4) produce projects that are a combination of art and performance with critical thinking about that process; and 5) prepare a portfolio of
their work.
As a senior year project, the Performance Studies Program strongly recommends the assembling of a senior portfolio. Preparation of the portfolio should
normally begin in the second semester of the junior year. It will be done under the supervision of a member of the advisory faculty and will be submitted in the
spring of the senior year. What we suggest is that portfolios should draw on at least four projects or productions. They should show critical self-reflection on the
creative processes, a comparison of the artistic media employed and also demonstrate performance criticism on the work of others.

PHILOSOPHY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor STEVEN GERRARD
Professors: DUDLEY***, GERRARD, SAWICKI, WHITE. Associate Professors: BARRY, CRUZ, MLADENOVIC. Assistant Professors:
MCPARTLAND. Harry C. Payne Distinguished Visiting Professor in Liberal Arts: AL-ASM. Visiting Assistant Professor: J. PEDRONI. Boskey
Visiting Professor in Philosophy: KARELIS. Bolin Fellow: WELCH.
To engage in philosophy is to ask a variety of questions about the world and our place in it. What can we know? What should we do? What may we hope?
What makes human beings human? These questions, in various forms, and others like them are not inventions of philosophers; on the contrary, they occur to most
people simply as they live their lives. Many of us ask them as children, but later either ignore them, or accept answers we can live with. Philosophers, however,
seek to keep such questions open, and to address them through reasoned discussion and argument, instead of accepting answers to them based on opinion or
prejudice.
The program in philosophy is designed to aid students in thinking about these issues, by acquainting them with influential work in the field, past and present,
and by training them to grapple with these issues themselves. The program emphasizes training in clear, critical thinking and in effective writing. Philosophy
courses center around class discussions and the writing of interpretive and critical essays.
MAJOR
Philosophy is a discipline with a long and intricate history, a history that remains an integral part of the discipline. In this way, it differs dramatically from the
natural sciences: for example, although no contemporary physicists or biologists embrace Aristotle's physics or biology, among philosophers there continue to be
champions of Aristotle's metaphysics and of his ethics. Because of the richness and continuing importance of the history of philosophy, the program is designed to
give majors a historical background that will acquaint them with a wide variety of approaches in philosophical issues, and will provide them with a basis for
evaluating and contributing to contemporary debates.
A total of nine courses is required for the major in Philosophy. Students should begin with Philosophy 101 and 102, in either order; both are required for the
major. These courses provide introductions to historical figures and themes that continue to be influential in many contemporary discussions in the two major
areas of philosophical inquiry, i.e., practical inquiry into issues of ethics and politics, and theoretical inquiry into issues of knowledge, belief, understanding, and
reality. The final required course is the Senior Seminar, Philosophy 401. Each student selects the six electives that complete the major. The exposure to figures and
topics in 101 and 102 provides students with some basis for choice, but optimal shaping of an individual curriculum requires in addition consultation with faculty
members and other students.
Generally speaking, as students progress from 100- to 300-level courses, there will be decreasing breadth and increasing depth. In addition, writing assign-
ments become longer, and students assume increasing responsibility for identifying and developing the topics of their essays. Finally, students in 300-level
courses are often required to assume responsibility for making oral presentations or guiding significant parts of class discussions.
Students considering graduate study in philosophy are strongly urged to develop reading competence in German, French, or Greek before graduation.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHILOSOPHY
The degree with honors in Philosophy is awarded to the student who has demonstrated outstanding achievement in a program of study that extends beyond the
requirements of the major. The extension beyond major requirements may take the form either of independent work culminating in a senior essay or thesis (the
independent-study route) or of additional course work (the directed-study route). Candidates must have GPAs of 3.6 or higher in their courses in philosophy at the
end of the junior and senior years. Juniors interested in pursuing honors should so inform the Department Chair no later than mid-April.
The independent-study route to honors requires the completion and defense of either a senior essay produced in the fall semester plus winter study period
(maximum 40 pages) or a year-long senior thesis (maximum 75 pages). Plans for either essay or thesis (including a brief proposal and bibliography, worked out in
consultation with an advisor) must be submitted to the department in April of the junior year. A recommendation for graduation with honors will be made on the
basis of the thoroughness, independence, and originality of the student's work.
The directed-study route to honors requires the completion of two courses in philosophy in addition to the nine required for the major. Candidates taking this
route must also submit to the department revised copies of two term papers (10 pages or longer) written for philosophy courses they have taken; each student will
be assigned an adviser to help guide the process of revision. A recommendation for graduation with honors will be made on the basis of the scope of the student's
course work, the quality of the student's participation in Philosophy 401, and the thoroughness, independence, and originality reflected in the submitted papers.
PHIL 101(F,S) Introduction to Moral and Political Philosophy (W)
Throughout the history of Western philosophy, there have been debates concerning how human beings should live: What should we do both with our lives as
wholes and in specific problematic situations? The debates have addressed us both as individuals and as members of political communities. This course aims to
aid us in responding to these debates, and in living our lives, on the basis of reasoned conclusions rather than from unrecognized presuppositions. This course
concentrates on some of the most influential ethical and political texts in western philosophy: Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Mill, and others.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, frequent short papers (totaling 20-30 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.

PHIL 102(F,S) Introduction to Metaphysics and Epistemology (W)
Metaphysics and epistemology are the two core pursuits of theoretical philosophy (as opposed to practical philosophy, the focus of Philosophy 101). Metaphysics
is concerned with the ultimate character of reality. The metaphysician seeks to develop knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion or belief) of all things natural,
human, and divine. She asks, for example: Are we free, or are our acts determined? Is there a God? If so, what must God be like? Epistemology is concerned with
how we determine the difference between knowledge and mere opinion. The epistemologist thus asks: What does it mean truly to know something? How can we
acquire such genuine knowledge? Answers to these epistemological questions are essential if we are to have any confidence in the methods and results of our
metaphysical investigations. This course will emphasize the established historical classics that provide the basis for understanding contemporary work on meta-
physics and epistemological issues; we will consider, among others, the work of Descartes, Hume, and Kant.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class discussion, frequent short papers (totaling 20-30 pages).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section). Preference given to first-year students and sophomores.

PHIL 103 Logic and Language (Not offered 2009-2010) (Q)
Logic is the study of reasoning and argument. More particularly, it concerns itself with the difference between good and bad reasoning, between strong and weak
arguments. We all examine the virtues and vices of good arguments in both informal and formal systems. The goals of this course are to improve the critical
thinking of the students, to introduce them to sentential and predicate logic, to familiarize them with enough formal logic to enable them to read some of the great
works of philosophy, which use formal logic (such as Wittgenstein's Tractatus), and to examine some of the connections between logic and philosophy.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a midterm, a final, frequent homework and problems sets.
No prerequisites. No enrollment limit (expected: 50-80).

PHIL 109T(S) Skepticism and Relativism (W)
Intellectually, we are ready skeptics and relativists. We doubt, we point out that no one can be certain in what she believes, and we are suspicious of declarations of
transcendent reason or truth (unless they are our own). Emboldened by our confidence in skeptical arguments, we claim that knowledge is inevitably limited, that
it depends on one's perspective, and that everything one believes is relative to context or culture. No domain of inquiry is immune to this destructive skepticism
and confident relativism. Science is only "true" for some people, agnosticism is the only alternative to foolish superstition, and moral relativism and, consequent-
ly, nihilism are obvious.
But is the best conclusion we can come to with respect to our intellectual endeavors that skepticism always carries the day and that nothing at all is true? In this
tutorial, we will investigate the nature of skepticism and the varieties of relativism it encourages. Our readings will come primarily from philosophy, but will be
supplemented with material from anthropology, physics, psychology, and linguistics. We will look at relativism with respect to reason and truth in general as well
as with respect to science, religion, and morality. Along the way, we will need to come to grips with the following surprising fact. With few exceptions, thorough-
going skepticism and relativism have not been the prevailing views of the greatest minds in the history of philosophy. Were they simply too unsophisticated and
confused to understand what is for us the irresistible power of skepticism and relativism? Or might it be that our skepticism and relativism are the result of our own
laziness and failure? Of course, this question cannot really be answered, nor is there any value in trying to answer it, and any "answer" will only be "true" for you.
Right?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: participants will present substantial written work in the tutorial every other week, and will be responsible for commenting on their
tutorial partner's work on off weeks.
No prerequisites; this tutorial is an appropriate first course in philosophy and is open to first year students. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference will be
given to sophomores and first-year students.

PHIL 201(F) Continental Philosophy: Reading the Critics of Reason
Nineteenth- and twentieth-century European philosophy gave rise to an astounding number of brilliant thinkers (including Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger,
Arendt, Lacan, Adorno, Gadamer, Habermas, Irigaray, Deleuze, and Derrida), who in turn initiated an equally astounding number of important philosophical
movements (including existentialism, structuralism, critical theory, hermeneutics, French feminism, and post-structuralism). Fortunately, this bewildering diver-
sity comprises a recognizable tradition in virtue of a common theme: the relentless critique of the conceptions and projects of reason inherited from the Enlighten-
ment, Kant, and Hegel. Unfortunately, because many of these critiques are written in ways that attempt to undermine and transform our notions of rationality, they
can be maddeningly difficult to read.
This course will introduce students to continental philosophy through guided readings of these challenging texts aimed at developing students interpretative skills.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: several short papers, final 8- to 10-page paper, regular attendance and participation

PHIL 202 Philosophy of Language and Philosophy of Mind (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
This course is designed to introduce students to twentieth-century philosophy by focusing on two of its premier research areas, language and mind. Each of these
topics been studied independently of the other, with the philosophy of language dominating the first half of the century and the philosophy of mind surging in the
second half. Research on language and mind have also enjoyed a fruitful liaison, as much of the technical apparatus of the philosophy of language has been used
to illuminate the mind. The other side of this coin is that language is something that minds achieve, and some prominent theories of linguistic meaning have
emphasized psychological elements of language use. The course will begin with the work of Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein, and end with the work of Putnam,
Dennett, Fodor and Churchland. The course is intended to prepare students for more advanced research on either language or mind. At the same time, the course
aims to offer an overview of the methods and intellectual style of analytic philosophy. Thus, it will also serve as preparation for advanced work in epistemology,
philosophy of science, metaphysics, and ethics. The syllabus can be found at: http://www.williams.edu/philosophy/fourth_layer/faculty_pages/jcruz/courses/
lang&mind.html.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: short writing assignments each week, and two longer papers.
Prerequisite: Philosophy 102 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12-18). Preference given to Philosophy, Psychology, Linguistics and
Computer Science majors.

(See under REL 204 for full description.) HAMMERSCHLAG
PHIL 207(S) The Unconscious (W)
Modern Philosophy of mind--from Descartes though Hume to Kant--relies on the natural assumption that all mental states are at least potentially conscious.
Beliefs, desires and intentions must belong to someone, to some subject--and from this it seems to follow that some subject must be aware of them as his or her
own. Sigmund Freud offers a radical challenge to this Cartesian picture when he introduces the idea that consciousness arises from an unconscious--the existence
of which undermines certainty about our reasons for belief. In this course we explore theories of the unconscious in contemporary analytic and continental philos-
ophy. We begin with close readings of Freud's seminal texts (including his case-studies) in order to elucidate his concept of unconscious mental states and his
view that human action cannot be understood without postulating unconscious beliefs and desires. We discuss the nature, evidence and reliability of Freud's
theory with reference to the writings of his many critics and defenders, including later Freudians. Finally we turn to radical transformations and applications of the
idea of the unconscious in post-Freudian philosophy of mind, moral philosophy, political theory and feminism. In addition to Freud, readings may include writ-
ings by Adler, Winnicott, Sartre, Davidson, Rorty, Lear, Gardiner, M. Cavell, Dennett, Moran, Wilkes, Marx, Marcuse, Foucault, and Butler.
Format: four weeks of lecture/discussion, six weeks of tutorials, and two weeks of seminar. Requirements: class participation, four 5- to 6-page papers and a final
paper.

PHIL 209 Philosophy of Science (Not offered 2009-2010)
It is a generally held belief, in our times and culture, that science is the best source of our knowledge of the world, and of ourselves. The aim of this course is to
examine the origins, grounds, and nature of this belief. We will analyze and discuss various accounts of scientific method, structure and justification of scientific
theories, scientific choice, change, and the idea that scientific knowledge is progressive. The course will begin with the "received view" of scientific theories,
methods, and knowledge, advanced by logical positivists, which assumes the objectivity and the rationality of science. We will then discuss philosophies of
science that emerged out of various criticisms of this view-especially those of Popper, Lakatos, Kuhn and Feyerabend-and the challenges to the assumptions of
scientific objectivity and rationality their works provoked. This discussion will naturally lead us to the relativist and social-constructivist views developed within
contemporary science studies. Finally, we will analyze the current debate about the cognitive credentials of science and the proper approach to the study of
science, which came to be known as "the science wars."
Requirements: frequent short assignments, class presentation, class participation, and a longer (5-7 pages) term paper.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 102; or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).

PHIL 210(F) Philosophy of Social Sciences (W)
Is it possible to have scientific knowledge of human thought, feelings, behavior, social life and history? If so, is that knowledge importantly different in kind or in
rigor from the knowledge we have of natural phenomena? Do social sciences legitimately employ different methodology than natural sciences? If so, what is that
methodology, is there a single one, and what is the cognitive goal it serves? If not, could social sciences improve their scientific credibility by emulating the
methodology of natural sciences? To answer these questions, we will discuss some of the following issues in the philosophy of social sciences: nature of `social
facts' and social reality; holism vs. reductionism; teleological, functional and structural explanations; theory formation, evidence, and the role of values in social
science; the relationship between knowers and the known; and some issues concerning agency, rationality, intentionality and understanding. The readings will
include Mill, Dilthey, Durkhem, Weber, Hempel, Rudner, Nagel, Popper, Winch, Taylor, Geertz, Rosenberg, MacIntyre, Hacking, Longino, Nelson, Wylie, and
other contemporary philosophers of social sciences.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation, 8 short weekly response papers (1-2 page), three longer (5 page) papers.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101 or 102 or 103; or consent of the instructor. Philosophy 209 is highly recommended. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10-15). Prefer-

PHIL 213T Biomedical Ethics (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
Much like the construction of medical knowledge itself, it is from specific cases that general principles of biomedical ethics arise and are systematized into a
theoretical framework, and it is to cases they must return, if they are to be both useful and comprehensible to those making decisions within the biomedical
context. In this tutorial we will exploit this characteristic of biomedical ethics by using a case-based approach to examining core concepts of the field. The first
portion of the course will be devoted to developing and understanding four moral principles which have come to be accepted as canonical: respect for autonomy,
beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. The remainder of the course will consider key concepts at the core of medical ethics and central issues for the field, such
as privacy and confidentiality, the distinction between killing and "letting die," therapy vs. research, and enhancement vs. therapy. To this end, each week we will
(1) read philosophical material focused on one principle or concept, and (2) consider in detail one bioethics case in which the principle or concept has special
application or relevance. In some weeks, students will be asked to choose from a small set which case they would like to address; in others the case will be
assigned. Students will meet with the professor in pairs for approximately one hour per week, writing and presenting 5- to 7-page essays every other week, and
commenting orally on partners' essays in alternate weeks.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on written work, on oral presentations of that work, and on oral critiques.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to declared and prospective philosophy majors and students committed to taking
the tutorial.

PHIL 220T Immortality and the Soul in Ancient and Medieval Thought (Same as Religion 282T) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
According to a 2003 poll, 84% of Americans believe that the soul survives death. Ideas about immortality and the soul have a long history, and have been at the
center some of the major philosophical and religious traditions of Western culture. The central aim of this course is to examine how some central figures in these
traditions think about immortality and the soul. In addition, we will discuss some of the philosophical difficulties that come to the fore when thinking about these
221
issues. Is the immortality of human persons even coherent? What would it mean for an individual to survive her own death? Does belief in the indestructibility of
the human soul have ethical implications? What evidence is there for the existence, let alone immortality, of the soul?
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will be expected to write a short paper every other week, and to give a presentation based on their papers. They will also
be expected to write a final paper. We will pay close attention to revising papers in light of peer and instructor feedback. We will also work on critically reading
and evaluating texts in the history of philosophy. Readings for the class may include: Homer, Plato, Aristotle, Fragments from the Stoics and Pre-Socratics,
Plotinus, Origen, Tertullian, Augustine, Moses Maimonides, Ibn Sina, Averroes, and Aquinas.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to sophomores.

PHIL 221(F) Greek Philosophy (Same as Classics 221)
Very few people believe that everything is water, that we knew everything before birth, that philosophers ought to rule the state, or that some people are natural
slaves. Why then should we spend our time studying people who in addition to having these crazy beliefs have been dead for 2500 years? First of all, Greek
thinkers, especially Plato and Aristotle, radically shaped the trajectory of western thought in every area of philosophy. No one can have an adequate understanding
of western intellectual history without some familiarity with the Greeks, and we might think that an understanding of our intellectual history can deepen our
understanding of our own situation. More importantly, many of the thinkers that we will read in this class are simply excellent philosophers, and it is worthwhile
for anyone interested in philosophical problems to read treatments of these problems by excellent philosophers. We will begin the course by looking at some of
the Presocratic philosophers active in the Mediterranean world of the seventh through fifth centuries BCE, and some of the sophists active in the fifth century. We
will then turn to several of Plato's dialogues, examining Plato's portrayal of Socrates and his development of a new and profoundly powerful philosophical
system. We will then read some of Aristotle's works on metaphysics, epistemology and ethics, and see how Aristotle's thought responds to that of predecessors.
We will end the course with a brief examination of some of the major movements in Hellenistic philosophy: Skepticism, Stoicism and Epicureanism. Roughly
equal amount of time will be spent on metaphysics and epistemology, and ethics and political philosophy.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: several short papers, term paper, attendance and active participation in class.
Prerequisites: at least one class in philosophy is strongly recommended. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 20). Preference given to current and prospective Philoso-
phy and Classics majors.

PHIL 224(S) The Philosophy of Sex and Domination (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 223) (W)
Why are so many of women's actions affected by the desire to be considered sexually desirable? In order to understand the complexity and conflicted nature of
women's sexuality, one must ask which social practices have shaped it. While pornography is a common focus for inquiry into woman's sexuality, this course
aims to examine the more subtle and embedded effects of patriarchy on sex and sexuality. We will discuss the works of theorists such as Sandra Bartky and
Catherine Mackinnon to understand the philosophical questions concerning the social meaning of sex/sexuality and its actual practice. These questions range
over seemingly uncontroversial gender differences, such as why women cross their legs, to more explicit questions, such as why the number of sexual occur-
rences is determined by male orgasm. We will then look at particular examples of the effects of male domination on sex/sexuality in daily life, including examples
such as women's beauty standards and the continual desire to protect against sexual violence, and compare them to social images about sex, including sexually
explicit images. This comparison will allow us to investigate the relation between woman's sexual powerlessness and social meanings of sex. The goal is to better
understand the deeper, more steadfast impressions of patriarchy on sex. This course aims to refine students' critical thinking and to engage them dialogically in
controversial social issues.
Format: lecture and discussion. Requirements: several short papers, final 8- to 10-page paper, regular attendance and participation.

PHIL 226(F) Big Games: The Spiritual Significance of Sports (Same as Religion 279)
Sports matter beyond all apparent reason. They are children's games, yet grip adults. They serve as entertainment, yet are taken most seriously. They demand
physical excellence, yet drive athletes to injury and spectators to become obese. The significance of contemporary sports is thus unquestionable, but it is also
unexplained. Diversion and fitness alone cannot begin to account for the extraordinary amounts of time, money, and emotion invested in the playing, watching,
and analysis of sports.
This course will attempt to comprehend the significance of sports by attending to their role as a source of three distinctive forms of "spiritual" experience: patrio-
tism, beauty, and divinity. We will consider the extent to which the fundamental elements of contemporary sports (games, athletes, equipment, arenas, fans, and
media) can be interpreted as together comprising a complex phenomenon that provides opportunities for all participants to share in these experiences. Throughout
we will investigate actual examples, taken from particular sports, chosen for their ability to illuminate different aspects of spiritual experience.
Format: lecture twice a week; scheduled discussion groups once per week. Requirements: quizzes, short writing assignments, final exam.

PHIL 227 Death and Dying (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
In this course we will examine traditional philosophical approaches to understanding death and related concepts, with a special focus on the ethical concerns
surrounding death and care for the dying. We will begin with questions about how to define death, as well as reflections on its meaning and function in human life.
We will move on to examine ethical issues of truth-telling with terminally ill patients and their families, decisions to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treat-
ments, the care of seriously ill newborns, physician-assisted suicide, euthanasia, and research efforts to extend the human life-span. In addition to key concepts of
death, dying, and terminal illness, we will develop and refine notions of medical futility, paternalism and autonomy, particularly within the context of advance
directives and surrogate decision making.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, two mid-length papers (7-10 pages), and weekly short writing assignments (2
pages). Possible experiential learning component.

PHIL 228 Feminist Bioethics (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 228) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
In this course we will explore the ways in which feminist approaches to moral thinking have influenced both the methodology and the content of contemporary
bioethics. The first portion of the course will address the emergence of the "Ethics of Care," critically assessing its origins in feminist theory, its development
within the context of the caring professions, and its potential as a general approach to bioethical reasoning. The second portion of the course will use feminist
philosophy to inform our understanding of the ways in which gender structures the individual's interactions with the health care system. To do this, we will
explore topics that might traditionally be considered "women's issues" in health care, such as medicine and body image (e.g., cosmetic surgery, eating disorders),
reproductive and genetic technologies, and research on women and their health care needs. In addition we will also look at feminist analyses of topics that tradi-
tionally haven't been identified as particularly gender specific, such as resource allocation and end of life issues.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, two mid-length papers (7-10 pages each), and weekly short writing assign-
ments (app. 2 pp. each).
No prerequisites, although previous coursework in Women's and Gender Studies is desirable. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 8-10). Preference given to Women's
and Gender Studies and Philosophy majors.

PHIL 229 Ethics and Genetics (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
The Human Genome Project, among other recent advancements in genetic technology, has already profoundly affected the conduct of basic biological sciences
and has the potential to revolutionize medical practice and agriculture. In this course we will examine the philosophical and ethical concerns that accompany the
use of genetic information and interventions. We will begin by addressing foundational conceptual questions, the first of which will be: what constitutes specifi-
cally genetic information and manipulation? In addition, we will consider the formulation and moral relevance of the distinctions between nature and artifice in
the genetic realm, the contribution of genetics to various notions of identity, and the relationship between moral responsibility and genetic influence or determin-
ism. The remainder--and bulk--of the course will take up specific ethical issues relating to genetic information and technology. Such topics may include privacy
and the disclosure of genetic information, genetic testing and screening, preimplantation genetic diagnosis and the creation of "savior" siblings, human gene
222
transfer (a.k.a. "gene therapy"), cloning of human and nonhuman animals, patenting and intellectual rights, genetic experimentation with humans, and the agri-
cultural use of genetically modified organisms.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active participation in class, periodic short writing assignments (2-3 pages each), and one long term paper (10-15
pages) on a topic of the student's choosing. Previous coursework in biology, genetics or philosophy may be helpful but is by no means required.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10-15). Preference given to Philosophy majors, Biology majors, and Pre-Med students.

PHIL 235T Morality and Partiality: Loyalty, Friendship, Patriotism (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
The aim of this tutorial is to critically examine the nature, importance, and ethical value of personal attachments and loyalties. Loyalty is frequently expected by
family, friends and lovers, and demanded by institutions, religious and political communities, as well as by the state. A person incapable of loyalty is often
characterized as fickle, cold, self-serving and sometimes even pathological. However, the status of loyalty as a virtue has always been suspect: it has been argued
that it is incompatible with impartiality, fairness and equality, and claimed that it is always exclusionary. So, some relationships with other people--such as
friendships, familial ties, love, patriotism--seem to be ethically desirable, central to the quality of our lives, and yet prima facie in tension with the widely held
belief that morality requires impartiality and equal treatment of all human beings. Are we ever justified in having more concern, and doing more, for our friends,
family, community or nation? Does morality require that we always subordinate our personal relationships to universal principles? Is patriotism incompatible
with cosmopolitanism, and if so, which of the two should we value? If loyalty is a virtue, what are the proper limits of its cultivation and expression? Philosophical
literature on this topic will include Plato and Aristotle on friendship and civic virtues (supplemented by secondary literature), contemporary discussion of the
moral value of personal relationships (B. Williams, A. Rorty, D. Velleman, L.A. Bloom, P. Railton) as well as texts on nationalism, patriotism, cosmopolitanism
and universal human rights written by contemporary philosophers, sociologists and political theorists (M. Nussbaum, R. Rorty, K.A. Appiah, S. Nathanson, I.
Primoratz).
Format: tutorial. Requirements: tutorial pairs will meet with the instructor for one hour a week; each student will write a 5-page paper every second week, and
comment on the tutorial partner's paper on alternate weeks. There will be no final paper.

MLADENOVIC
PHIL 236(F) Contemporary Ethical Theory (W)
Is sacrificing an individual's welfare for the sake of the community ever justified, or does each individual have an inviolable status that must be respected? Should
moral considerations always take priority over personal projects and intimate relationships, or are there some spheres in which we should be free to pursue our
goals without concern for morality? We will explore these and related questions by systematically comparing the two dominant ethical theories of the 20th
century, consequentialism and deontology. While both theories find their roots in earlier thinkers--consequentialism in Mill and Sidgwick, deontology in Kant--
our focus will be on contemporary developments of these views. After examining these approaches in depth, we'll turn our attention to recent theories that attempt
to transcend the distinctions that divide consequentialist and deontological views. Readings include works by Bentham, Mill, Nozick, Railton, Brink, Williams,
Wolf, Taurek, Rawls, Smart, Scheffler, Nagel, Kant, Kamm, Quinn, Kagan, Ross, and Scanlon. This is a writing intensive course.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: several short response papers; an 8- to 10-page midterm paper; a 10- to 12-page final paper.

PHIL 237 What Does a Work of Art Mean? (Not offered 2009-2010)
According to myth, the Philosopher's Stone could turn iron into gold. According to this course, even more amazing is that configurations of colored paint or
sound waves or ink stains can be turned into art, music, and literature. How is that a work of art can have a meaning? What does it mean for a work of art to have a
meaning? Must a work of art have a meaning? Is the meaning of art similar to, or different from, the meaning of language?
We will examine works of visual art, such as Marcel Duchamp's L.H.O.O.Q., works of music, such as Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong's 1961 recording of
"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)," and works of literature such as Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire. We will read such philosophers as Gottlob
Frege, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Arthur Danto, Nelson Goodman, and Catherine Elgin. Most of the art we investigate and most of the philosophers we read will be
from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.
Format: seminar with some lectures. Requirements: frequent imaginative short assignments and a final project.
No prerequisites; open to first years. Enrollment limit: 30 (expected: 20). Preference given to seniors and juniors.

PHIL 238(F) Justice, Terrorism, and Weapons of Mass Destruction (Sames as Political Science 237)
What is generally known as Just War Theory (JWT), first clearly formulated by Augustine and then developing both theistic and non-theistic variants, both of
which have been forced to adapt as technological advances have brought with them new forms of violence that the theories must take into consideration, are
currently challenged by terrorism, torture, and weapons of mass destruction. This seminar will review prominent current forms of JWT, examining how each
deals with these challenges; its goal will be to discover, or perhaps in part to formulate, the currently best available theory concerning the political ethics of torture,
terrorism, counterterrorism, and the production and uses of weapons of mass destruction.
Format: seminar. Requirements: attendance, preparation, participation; regular short writing assignments and/or class presentations; a term paper (10-15 pages).
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101 or Political Science 203 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 19. Preference given to prospective and current Philoso-

PHIL 241T Philosophy of Education: Why Are You Here? (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
Students compete ferociously for the opportunity to pay large sums of money for the privilege of attending Williams College. The value of the educational
experience they receive is usually taken to be self-evident. Less obvious, however, is the nature of education itself. What is education? Which purposes can and
should it serve? Is education the sort of thing that can be "received" and, if so, how?
These questions about the nature of education are essential to philosophy, and also to the history and future of Williams College. Since the time of Plato and
Aristotle philosophers have sought to determine the educational practices most conducive to human wisdom and flourishing. American liberal arts colleges offer
a distinctive form of educational experience, and thus a distinctive response to the philosophical challenge to specify the optimal means of human development.
In this tutorial students will read and discuss classic texts in the philosophy of education in close conjunction with materials concerning the emergence and present
practices of liberal arts colleges in America. Special attention will be paid to Williams College, and students will be encouraged to reflect upon their own educa-
tional goals and choices in light of the philosophical works that they read.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: each week one tutorial partner will write a 5- to 7-page paper on the assigned reading, which the other partner will critique. The
two partners will switch roles in alternate weeks.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101, or Philosophy 102, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment Limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to majors or
prospective majors in philosophy. Several spaces will be reserved for sophomores.

PHIL 243(F) The Philosophy, Politics, and Economics of Poverty (Same as Economics 243 and Political Science 243)
This course will look at poverty in the developed nations from the perspective of three disciplines--philosophy, political science, and economics. Poverty in
many of the developed nations has not responded to antipoverty efforts in recent decades. In the United States, for instance, the percentage of people in poverty
has remained basically unchanged for forty years, and Americans born poor are much likelier than other Americans to be poor in their adult lives. We will begin
by asking what political factors and what philosophical and economic assumptions have shaped these unsuccessful antipoverty efforts since 1970. To what extent
has poverty been seen as a function of restricted opportunity? To what degree has poverty been seen as a function of character, culture, and public policy itself?
How valid is each of these competing ideas about the causes of poverty, and what are the policy implications of our answer? In short, what can be done to make
antipoverty policy more effective? Given that economic inequality has grown during the past four decades, can we define a "just" balance between a market-
based allocation of income and the socialist principle of "to each according to his need"? Thinkers to be considered will be drawn from each of the three disci-
plines. Examples from philosophy are Aristotle, Bentham, Mill, and John Rawls. From economics: Jevons, Samuelson, Nobel laureates Kahneman and Tversky,
223
and Sunstein and Thaler. From the realm of political thought: Michael Harrington, Mary Jo Bane, Charles Murray, and David Ellwood and members the Obama
Administration.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: four 1- to 2-page papers, a midterm, a quiz, a 10-page final paper and thoughtful class participation.
Prerequisites: one semester of philosophy and one semester of either political science or economics. While coursework in economics is not a prerequisite, stu-
dents should be willing to take seriously quantitative approaches to the explanation of human behavior. Enrollment limit: 20. (expected: 20). Preference will be
given to current or prospective majors in Philosophy, Political Science or Economics.

PHIL 271T Woman as "Other" (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 271T) (Not offered 2009-2010) (D) (W)
At mid-century, Simone de Beauvoir, existential philosopher and perhaps the greatest feminist theorist of the twentieth century, described woman as "living in a
world where men compel her to assume the status of the Other." At the same time, Beauvoir asserts: "One is not born a woman, one becomes one." How, given
their objectification, can women become subjects for themselves? Is authenticity even possible? Must the relation between self and other inevitably be one of
objectification and domination? Is reciprocity and mutuality in self-other relations possible? In our efforts to deepen our understanding of these important philo-
sophical questions, questions that have been at the center of social and political thought at least since Hegel introduced the dialectic of master and slave, we will
engage in close readings of writings by Beauvoir (including autobiography and biography), as well as philosophers responding to her--Frantz Fanon, Luce
Irigary and Judith Butler.
Format: tutorial. Students will work in pairs. Requirements: each student will write and present orally a 5-page essay every other week. Students not presenting
essays will prepare oral critiques of their partners' essays. Evaluation will be based on written work, oral presentations of essays, and oral critiques.
Prerequisites: one course in either Philosophy or Women's and Gender Studies. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to current and prospective
Philosophy and Women's and Gender Studies majors.

PHIL 272T Free Will and Responsibility (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
In moral and legal decisions we hold people responsible for their deliberate actions. This practice seems justified as long as people are free to make the choices
that they do. But which criteria must a decision meet in order to qualify as free? Clearly, a free decision must not be the result of external coercion. But must the
decision also be free from any outside influence at all? If so then freedom may seem impossible, for we are all deeply influenced by external factors ranging from
the general laws of nature to specific features of our genetic endowment and social environment including religion, political ideology, and advertising. These
affect not only our particular choices but also, more fundamentally, who we are and what we value. Since it is undeniable that we are pervasively influenced by
such forces, the real question is whether, and how, free choice is possible amidst all of these influences. In this course we will examine the best-known recent
philosophical attempts to make sense of the nature of free will and responsibility. Since these issues have a direct bearing on which theory of legal punishment we
should accept, we will also examine influential theories of punishment. Our focus will be on works by contemporary authors.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students meet with the instructor in pairs for roughly an hour each week; each student will write a 5- to 6-page paper every other
week (6 in all) and comment on his or her tutorial partner's paper in alternate weeks. Emphasis will be placed on developing skills in reading, interpretation and
oral argument as well as critical reasoning and writing.
Prerequisite: Philosophy 101 or 102, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to current and prospective
Philosophy majors and students committed to taking the tutorial.

PHIL 274T Messing with People: The Ethics of Human Experimentation (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
From the now infamous Tuskegee Syphilis Study and Stanley Milgram's Obedience experiments, to lesser known but equally important landmarks in research
ethics--such as the Willowbrook experiment, in which residents of a state home for mentally retarded children were intentionally infected with a virus that causes
hepatitis, and the Kennedy-Krieger Lead Abatement study, which tested the efficacy of a new, inexpensive lead paint removal procedure by offering to low-in-
come parents of young children reduced-rate housing in lead-abated units and testing those children for lead exposure--in this sophomore tutorial we will closely
examine a series of contemporary and historical cases of human experimentation (roughly, one case per week) with an eye toward elucidating the moral norms
that ought to govern human subjects research. A number of conceptual themes will emerge throughout the course of the term, including notions of exploitation
and coercion, privacy and confidentiality, and the balance between public interests and individual rights. Specific issues will include the ethics of placebo re-
search, deception in research, studies of illicit/illegal behavior, genetic research, experimentation with children, pregnant women and fetuses, and persons with
diminished mental capacity, among other topics. Students will meet with the professor in pairs for approximately one hour per week, writing and presenting 5- to
7-page essays every other week, and commenting orally on their partners' essays in alternate weeks.
Format: tutorial. Evaluations will be based on written work, on oral presentations of that work, and on oral critiques.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to prospective philosophy majors and students committed to taking the tutorial.

PHIL 280 Frege, Russell, and the Early Wittgenstein (Not offered 2009-2010)
The last line of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus famously reads: "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." Are there things that cannot be put into
words? What are the limits of language? What is the nature of language? How do logic and language relate? We will examine these (and other questions) in the
context of the great philosophical revolution at the beginning of the last century: the linguistic turn and the birth of analytic philosophy. We will see how a focus on
language affects our understanding of many traditional philosophical questions, ranging from epistemology and metaphysics to aesthetics and ethics. Our texts
will include Gottlob Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic, Bertrand Russell, Principles of Mathematics, and Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophi-
cus.
While you're debating whether to take this class, consider the following puzzle. There is a village where the barber shaves (a) all those and (b) only those who do
not shave themselves. Now, ask yourself: who shaves the barber? You will see that if the barber does not shave himself, then by condition (a) he does shave
himself. And, if the barber does shave himself, then by condition (b) he does not shave himself. Thus, the barber shaves himself if and only if he does not shave
himself. See if you can figure out why this is sometimes called a paradox, and then ask yourself what this has to do with our opening questions.
Format: seminar. Requirements: two short papers (5 pages) and one longer final paper (12-15 pages).
Prerequisite: Philosophy 102. Expected enrollment: 12-15. Preference give first to Philosophy majors, and then to seniors and juniors of any major.

PHIL 281T(S) Philosophy of Religion (Same as Religion 302) (W)
Our goal in this course will be to try to determine how far reason can justify belief in God. We will spend at least half of the semester examining the best-known
philosophical arguments for and against the existence of God (including the ontological argument, the cosmological argument, the teleological argument, the
argument from religious experience, the argument from evil, and the argument from religious disagreement). For each one, we will first look at historically
important formulations of the argument and then turn to contemporary reformulations. Our aim will be to identify and then evaluate the strongest version of each
argument. After working through these arguments, we will reflect more generally on the proper roles of reason and faith in justifying religious belief. In the final
section of the course we shall examine the relationship between god and morality. Authors will include Plato, Anselm, Aquinas, Pascal, Paley, Hume, Kant,
Kierkegaard, Freud, Marx, and several contemporary philosophers.
Format: tutorial; emphasis will be placed on developing skills in reading, interpretation and oral argument as well as critical reasoning and writing. Requirements:
students meet with the instructor in pairs for roughly an hour each week; each student will write a 5- to 6-page paper every other week (six in all) and comment on
his or her tutorial partner's paper in alternate weeks.

PHIL 290 The Philosophy and Economics of Higher Education (Same as Economics 214 and INTR 290) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
Students compete ferociously for the opportunity to pay large sums of money for the privilege of attending Williams College. The value of the educational
experience they receive is usually taken to be self-evident. Less obvious, however, are the nature of education, and the factors that determine how much it costs,
who has access to it, and how successful it is.
This interdisciplinary seminar will explore both the philosophy and the economics of higher education. Which purposes can and should college serve? Which
curricular and extra-curricular programs best accomplish those purposes? How can we measure and evaluate the effects of policies concerning college admission,
224
pricing, and financial aid? How can we assess and enhance educational productivity?
Students will read and discuss texts in the philosophy of education, while also learning to apply economic theory and econometric techniques to the analysis of
educational issues.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based upon the writing and revision of three 8-page papers, as well as the quality of contributions to class discus-
sion.
Prerequisites: Economics 110 and at least one philosophy course. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to sophomores intending to or juniors
majoring in either philosophy or economics.
Students will get credit for one philosophy course, which fulfills one-semester of the Division II requirement.

PHIL 301 Textual Meaning and Interpretation (Same as Linguistics 330) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
Early philosophy of language focused on meaning of assertions, denials and descriptions. However, this approach is too narrow, since people use language to do a
myriad of things: to ask, demand, promise, praise, blame, threaten, command, insinuate, evoke, express feelings, and sometimes just to play. The philosophical
study of what we do in language, and how we understand one another, is called pragmatics; within the analytic tradition, the main philosophical contributions to
the study of pragmatics in language came from Peirce, Wittgenstein, Austen, Grice and Searle. Other philosophers and literary theorists have used some of their
ideas recently to throw light on the nature of textual meaning and the interpretation of literary texts. We shall first explore the salient features of the pragmatic
approaches to language, paying special attention to Austin's notion of illocutionary force and Grice's notion of non-natural meaning. We will then examine how
these notions may be exploited in the consideration of various long-standing issues in the theory of literary interpretation. We will discuss the importance of
specific genre conventions and broader contextual matters to the interpretation of literary texts (along the lines suggested by Quentin Skinner); the possibility of
using intention to rule out mistaken and arrive at acceptable interpretations, if not a single correct interpretation (a possibility denied by such relativists as Stanley
Fish); the use and meaning of metaphors; and the host of questions surrounding the "intentional fallacy" (the alleged result of invoking authorial intention to
determine textual meaning).
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, 10 short weekly response papers, and 2 longer (5-7 page) papers.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 102 or 103. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 6-10). Open to all students, preference given to philosophy majors.

PHIL 304T(S) Authenticity: From Rousseau to Poststructuralism (W)
The eighteenth-century aesthetician Edward Young once asked: "Born originals, how comes it to pass we die copies?" In the same century Jean-Jacques Rous-
seau responds to this question by charting the individual's "fall" into society; that is, into artifice, hypocrisy, vanity, and conformism. This tutorial begins with
Rousseau's reflections on authentic individuality as they are developed in several of his works. We then trace the idea of authenticity (as an aesthetic and ethical
category) in both literary and philosophical texts associated with romanticism, existentialism, critical theory, psychoanalytic theory, and posthumanism. We con-
clude with recent challenges to the coherence, viability, and value of the ideal of authenticity as it applies not only to individuality, but also to group identities.
Themes and questions investigated include the following: (1) Must "authenticity" refer to some notion of an innate core or deep self? Are there other terms in
which we can imagine "being ourselves"? (2) Does being authentic require that one defy social conventions or is it compatible with adopting conventional roles?
(3) What impact do consumerism, mass media and contemporary technologies (particularly human-machine couplings and nanotechnology) have on thinking
about authenticity? Students will work with partners. Each student will write and present orally an essay of 5-6 pages every other week on an assigned topic in the
reading for that week and serve as a commentator on alternate weeks.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on written work, oral presentation of essays, and critiques.
Prerequisite: one course in Philosophy or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

PHIL 305 Existentialism and Phenomenology (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
According to Jean-Paul Sartre, the only philosopher to ever refer to himself as an "existentialist," existence precedes essence. What is essential to human being is
not any fixed set of characteristics, but rather what a human being becomes and how it defines and creates itself under conditions it does not choose. In this course
we address key themes and figures from two of the most influential movements in twentieth century European philosophy, namely, existentialism and pheno-
menology, a philosophical approach to which existentialism is indebted. We will discuss major works (philosophical, literary, visual) by such figures as Edmund
Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Richard Wright, Ingmar Bergman and Jean-Luc
Godard. We will raise questions concerning the task of philosophy, the structure and meaning constituting function of consciousness, the relationship between self
and other, the mind-body relationship, freedom, authenticity, and absurdity.
Format: seminar. Requirements: short critical response papers, occasional short class presentations based on outlines of the text, and three 5- to 6-page papers.
Students will be required to re-write one of the three papers in lieu of a final exam.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101 or 102 or 240 or 271T or 304T or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10-15). Preference given to majors and

PHIL 308(F) Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations
Bertrand Russell claimed that Ludwig Wittgenstein was "perhaps the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as traditionally conceived--passionate,
profound, intense, and dominating." Wittgenstein's two masterpieces, the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and the Philosophical Investigations, stand like oppos-
ing poles around which schools of twentieth-century analytic philosophy revolve. The Wittgenstein of the Tractatus is known as the "earlier Wittgenstein," the
Wittgenstein of the Investigations is known as the "later Wittgenstein." This course is an intensive, line-by-line study of the Investigations--one of the greatest
(and thus, one of the most controversial) books in the history of philosophy. Aside from its overwhelming influence on 20- and 21st-century philosophy and
intellectual culture, any book which contains the remark, "if a lion could talk, we could not understand him," deserves serious attention.
Format: seminar. Requirements: one short midterm paper (5-7 pages) and one longer final paper (12-15 pages).

Hour: 2:35-3:50 TF GERRARD
PHIL 309 Kant (Not offered 2009-2010)
This course will provide an intensive study of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Kant's transcendental idealism is profoundly important: it constitutes a challenge
to rationalist metaphysics, a response to Hume's empiricist skepticism, and systematically integrates epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics in a way that has shaped
modern Western thought. It is also profoundly difficult: more than 200 years after its development, there is still vehement disagreement not only over whether or
not Kant was right, but over what Kant actually said. In this course our goal will be to understand Kant's philosophy as a systematic whole, in terms of the
tight-knit relationships that bind all his ideas into one comprehensive vision. We will attempt to understand what Kant said and why, how it is important, and the
extent to which it is right. We will read significant portions of all three of Kant's most important works (the Critique of Pure Reason, Critique of Practical Reason,
and Critique of Judgment), and may occasionally make use of secondary literature.
Requirements: several short assignments; final paper of 12-15 pages.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 102. Expected enrollment: 5-15.

PHIL 310 Evil (Not offered 2009-2010)
What is evil, and why does it exist? Can nature be evil, or is all evil attributable to the freely willed actions of human beings? Is evil compatible with God, or is it a
powerful argument for atheism? Can evil be understood, or is it necessarily incomprehensible? These persistent and perplexing questions, which arise from the
suffering of people in every time and place, have drawn the sustained attention of the greatest thinkers in the Western philosophical tradition. This course will
examine some of the most important and influential responses to the problems that the existence of evil poses. We will begin with Leibniz, who coined the term
"theodicy" to name the project of defending God from the charge that a truly perfect being could not have created a world that contains evil. Other authors to be
considered may include: Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, Marx, Voltaire, Hume, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Freud, Camus, and Arendt. In the course of our reflections we
will discuss some of the events that make evil not merely an intellectual challenge, but also an immediate and pressing practical concern, including Auschwitz,
9/11, and Hurricane Katrina.

PHIL 317 The Philosophy of Hilary Putnam (Not offered 2009-2010)
Hilary Putnam is considered by many (including the professor of this course) to be the world's foremost living philosopher. Putnam is famous for both changing
his mind and for the breadth of his interests. He was one of the earliest proponents of the view that human beings are importantly analogous to computers, and
then later, one of the chief critics of that view. Putnam's works range from the philosophy of logic and physics to the philosophy of education and history. He has
written on philosophers from Aristotle and Kant to Levinas and Dewey. He has examined both the consistency of mathematics and the consistency of religion. In
this course we will study the full range of Putnam's work.
Format: seminar. Requirements: frequent short assignments and presentations and a major final paper.

PHIL 318(S) Necessity and Possibility (W)
You are reading this course description right now. However, it seems true to say that you might have been doing something else, something more fun, instead. In
other words, while it is true that you are reading, it doesn't seem to be necessary that you are reading. It seems to be possible for you to be doing something else.
On the other hand, some claims seem to be necessarily true. For example, it seems to be necessary that anything that is reading this description exists, and it seems
to be necessary that two plus two is equal to four. In other words, it is impossible that two plus two be anything other than four, or that something read without
existing. Furthermore, while there are some things about you that seem to be accidental, other things about you seem to be essential. You might not have been a
Williams student, on the other hand I don't think that you could have been a goldfish. While being a Williams student seems accidental to you, being human
seems to be part of your essence. But what is it for a claim to be necessary? Is necessity a matter of the way that we think about the world, or is necessity a feature
of reality independently of the way we think of it? If necessity is a feature of reality, what sort of feature is it? What is it for a feature to be essential to a thing? In
this course, we will examine a series of questions about necessity and possibility raised in contemporary metaphysics, logic, and philosophy of language. Central
readings in the class will be drawn from the work of Bertrand Russell, Gottlob Frege, Rudolf Carnap, W. V. O. Quine, Saul Kripke, David Lewis, David Kaplan,
and Kit Fine. This class will be quite technical, and it is strongly recommended that students have a familiarity with first-order logic.
Format: seminar. Requirements: several short response pieces, two 10-page papers that will involve substantial revision in light of instructor feedback, active
participation in seminar meetings.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 102 or permission of instructor. It is strongly recommended that students have also taken Philosophy 103 (Logic) or an equivalent class.

PHIL 327T(F) Foucault (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 327) (W) (D)
This course begins with a brief introduction to some of Foucault's early writings but focuses on a close reading of middle and late texts that have become central to
debates about the significance of his work: Discipline and Punish, The History of Sexuality (vols. 1-3), and selected interviews and course lectures. We examine
debates in the Foucault literature about freedom, power, ethics, and the nature of critical theory. This course has been designated EDI because it engages questions
concerning power, social differences and social and political freedom.
Format: tutorial. Evaluations will be based on written work (six 5- to 6-page papers), oral presentations of that work, and on oral critiques. Prerequisites: at least
two courses in philosophy or Women's and Gender Studies, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 8-10). Preference given to current or

PHIL 330 Plato (Same as Classics 330) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
Plato is one of the most important and influential thinkers in the history of the western tradition. His depiction of the trial and death of Socrates is one of the
classics of western literature, and his views on ethics and politics continue to occupy a central place in our discussions 2400 years after they were written. It is, in
fact, quite difficult to get through any course of study in the liberal arts without some familiarity with Plato. Nevertheless, comparatively few people realize that
the views we commonly think of as "Platonic" represent only one strand in Plato's thought. For example, we commonly attribute to Plato a theory of the Forms on
the basis of his claims in the so-called "middle dialogues" (mainly Republic, Phaedo, and Symposium). However, in his philosophically more sophisticated and
notoriously difficult later dialogues (such as the Parmenides, Philebus, Sophist and Statesman), Plato engages in radical criticism and revision of his earlier views.
In this course, we will spend the first third of the semester attempting to understand the metaphysics and epistemology in Plato's middle dialogues. We will spend
the balance of the semester coming to grips with Plato's arguments in the later dialogues. We will read several complete dialogues in translation, and will also read
a wide variety of secondary source material.
Format: lecture/discussion. This class will be a roughly equal mixture of lectures, student presentations, and seminar discussion. Requirements: students will be
expected to prepare a seminar presentation, to write several focused short analytical pieces, and to write a 15- to 20-page term paper in multiple drafts.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101, Philosophy 102 or permission of instructor. (A prior course in logic will be extremely helpful, but is not necessary.) Enrollment
limit: 15 (expected: 15). Preference given to upper-level Philosophy and Classics majors. This course is part of the Critical Reasoning and Analytical Skills

PHIL 331 Contemporary Epistemology (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
Epistemology is one of the core areas of philosophical reflection. In this course, we will study the literature in contemporary philosophy on the nature of knowl-
edge and rational belief. Epistemologists seek answers to the following kinds of questions:
--When is it rational to have a particular belief?
--What is knowledge (as opposed to mere opinion)?
--In order to be justified in holding a belief, must someone know (or believe) that she is justified in holding that belief?
--What, if anything, justifies our scientific knowledge?
These questions are typically asked within a framework where the overarching goal is attaining truth and avoiding falsity. Beyond this common ground, however,
epistemologists are much divided. Some maintain that these issues are solely the provinces of philosophy, using traditional a priori methods. Others maintain that
these questions will only yield to methods that incorporate our broader insight into the nature of the world including, perhaps, feminist thought or science. Both
stances face severe difficulties. Further, even where there is agreement as to the proper way of answering epistemological questions, there is a stunning variety of
possible answers to each question. The syllabus can be found at: http://www.williams.edu/philosophy/fourth_layer/faculty_pages/jcruz/courses/episty.html
Format: seminar. Requirements: short writing assignments each week, and a final paper written in several drafts.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 102 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 5-12). Preference given to Philosophy, Psychology, Linguistics, and
Computer Science majors.

PHIL 332 Aristotle (Same as Classics 332) (Not offered 2009-2010)
Aristotle's status as a central figure in Western philosophy is undisputed. For hundreds of years during the Middle Ages, Aristotle was simply referred to as "The
Philosopher." Aristotle is also credited with the invention of logic, biology, physics, political science, linguistics, and aesthetics. His writings on metaphysics,
epistemology, and ethics set the course for much of the subsequent philosophical discussion which continues to the present day. In this class, we will examine
some of Aristotle's central metaphysical, epistemological and ethical views. There are two main objectives in this course: (1) We will work to sympathetically
reconstruct Aristotle's views from translations of his primary texts; (2) We will investigate the extent to which these views are relevant to contemporary discus-
sions in philosophy.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: several short writing assignments, final paper, attendance and active participation in class.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101 or 102 or 221. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 12).

PHIL 334(S) Greek and Roman Ethics (Same as Classics 334) (W)
Most thoughtful human beings spend a good deal of time musing about how we ought to live. The philosophers of ancient Greece and Rome were among the first
thinkers to develop rigorous arguments in response to such musings. While ancient scientific theories and the philosophical systems constructed in accordance
with these theories might be of interest only to scholars of the ancient world, the moral philosophy produced in Greece and Rome remains as relevant today as it
was when it was written. In this course, we will closely examine some central texts in ancient moral philosophy. We will begin by reading several of Plato's early
dialogues and the entirety of his Republic. We will then turn to Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, as well as selections from his Eudemian Ethics, Magna Moralia
and Politics. Finally we will examine some central texts in the Stoic and Epicurean traditions, as well as some of Cicero's contributions to moral philosophy. We
will pay special attention to how different thinkers conceive of the nature of happiness, the nature of virtue, and the relation between the two. We will also spend a
good deal of time thinking about the moral psychology of the thinkers we read.
Format: seminar. Requirements: several short response pieces, two 10-page papers which will involve substantial revision in light of instructor feedback, active
participation in seminar meetings.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 221 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10-15). Preference given to majors in Philosophy and Classics.

PHIL 335 Contemporary Metaethics (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
We often speak as if moral judgments can be true or false, well-reasoned or not. But how should objectivity in this domain be understood? Is moral objectivity like
scientific objectivity, assuming we have a clear sense of what that involves? If not, should that concern us? Are there other models for understanding moral
objectivity besides science? While answers to such questions are implicit in historically important accounts of morality, these issues became the topic of explicit,
sustained debate in the twentieth century. Our focus will be on the most recent and sophisticated work in this area. We will examine several different approaches in
depth, including realism, constructivism, expressivism, and skepticism. Readings will include works by Moore, Stevenson, Harman, Mackie, Railton, Boyd,
Blackburn, Williams, McDowell, Korsgaard, and Nagel.
Format: seminar. Requirements: final paper, several shorter assignments, attendance and participation.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101 required; one 200- or 300-level Philosophy course is recommended. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 5-15). Preference given to
Philosophy majors and those considering the Philosophy major.

PHIL 337T(F) Justice in Health Care
Justice is a notoriously complex and elusive philosophical concept, the conditions of which are even more difficult to articulate within real world institutions and
contexts than in the abstract. In this course we'll explore justice as a fundamental moral principle and as a desideratum of the US health care system. The first
portion of the course will be devoted to considering general theories of justice as well as alternative conceptions of justice within the health care context. This will
provide the background for subsequent examination of specific topics, which may include, among others: justice in health care financing and reform, which may
include an analysis of any Obama administration proposal(s); justice in health care rationing, with particular attention to the relationship between rationing criteria
and gender, "race," disability, and age; justice in the procurement and allocation of organs for transplantation; AIDS and personal responsibility for illness; and
justice in medical research, including "double standards" for research conducted in less developed countries.
Format: tutorial. Evaluations will be based on written work, on oral presentations of that work, and on oral critiques.
Prerequisites: none. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference will be given to Philosophy majors, to students in the International Studies Global Health
Track, and to students committed to taking the tutorial.
Tutorial meetings to be arranged. PEDRONI
PHIL 340 Contemporary Metaphysics (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
In this course, we will examine a number of issues in contemporary metaphysics. Possible topics include: realism and anti-realism, the problem of universals, the
nature of necessity, causation, material constitution, the nature of time, personal identity, and freedom of the will. While we will be concerned to place our discus-
sions of these issues in historical context, almost all of the reading for the class will consist in articles written by contemporary philosophers working in what is
sometimes called the "analytic" tradition.
Format: lecture and discussion. Evaluation: two long papers (at least one of which will be re-written), short response papers, and active participation in class.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 102 (familiarity with formal logic helpful but not required). Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 10).
MCPARTLAND
PHIL 351(F) Philosophy of Art
Philosophical debates about art are both an important part of philosophy and a useful way for students of the arts to deepen their understanding of painting,
literature, drama, film, and the other media. We will begin with a series of classic texts and debates: Plato, Rousseau, and Hegel on the value of art as a source of
moral insight and moral growth; Hume and Kant on the universality and objectivity of taste; and (from the 20th century) Roger Fry, E.H. Gombrich and Arthur
Danto on the value of representational and abstract art. Then we will turn to contemporary philosophers of art. Kendall Walton and others have built on the
deceptively simple insight that representational works are props in rule-governed games of make-believe, and that together these rules and props give rise to
"fictional worlds." How is the fictional world of a work of art like and unlike the real world? Are fictional worlds more or less knowable than the real world? Can
spelling out the rules of the games of make-believe that are played with artistic objects deepen our understanding of the various media and genres, and in turn
deepen our understanding of particular works?
Format: lecture/discussion, often using particular works of art for illustration. Requirements: four 1- to 2-page papers, a midterm, a quiz, a 10-page final paper and
thoughtful class participation.
Prerequisites: one introductory course in philosophy or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected 10-15). Preference given to Philosophy ma-
jors.

(See under AFR 402 for full description.) ROBERTS
PHIL 379(S) American Pragmatism (Same as American Studies 379)
Along with jazz, pragmatism stands as the greatest uniquely American contribution to world culture. As the music wails in the background, we will study the
classic pragmatists: William James, C. S. Peirce, and John Dewey. We will continue with the contemporary inheritors of the tradition: Cornel West, Richard
Rorty, and Hilary Putnam. Although it has influenced both analytic and continental philosophy, pragmatism is a powerful third philosophical movement. Always
asking what practical difference would it make, our authors investigate the central questions and disputes of philosophy, from epistemology and metaphysics to
ethics and religion. Rather than seeing philosophy as an esoteric discipline, the pragmatic philosophers (with the possible exception of Peirce) see philosophy as
integral to our culture and see themselves as public intellectuals.
Format: seminar. Requirements: final paper, several short assignments.
Prerequisite: Philosophy 102. Expected enrollment: 12-15. Preference given first to Philosophy and American Studies majors, and then to seniors and juniors of
any major.
Hour: 2:35-3:50 MR GERRARD
PHIL 380 Relativism (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
`Relativism' is a term often used in philosophy for a great number of very different views. The aim of the course is to survey, analyze and discuss many varieties
of relativism--semantic, epistemic, ontological and moral--from Plato's Theaetetus to contemporary social constructivism. We will pay special attention to the
structure of arguments for and against relativism, as well as to the moral motivations and perceived consequences of its endorsement or rejection. We will thus be
led to discuss some of the concepts common to epistemology, metaphysics and ethics: reason, justification, objectivity, understanding, reality and truth. Some of
the questions we will consider are: Are moral standards relative to cultural frameworks? Are there incompatible but equally true ways of describing the world? Is
rationality--the notion of a good reason to believe something--relative to cultural norms? Is relativism a form of skepticism? Is it forced on people who endorse
cultural pluralism as their political ideal as the only tenable philosophical position?
Our readings will include the relevant works of Plato, Sextus Empiricus, Bayle, Locke, Berkeley, Carnap, Quine, Davidson, Goodman, Elgin, Hacking, Krausz,
Foot, Williams, Harman and Thomson.
Format: seminar. Requirements: This is a writing intensive course. Each student will write 10 weekly short papers (1000 words each); give a class presentation
and lead the ensuing discussion; and write a final paper (7-10 pages). Prerequisites: Philosophy 101 and 102, and at least one 200 level philosophy course.
Enrollment limit: 19 (expected 7-10).

PHIL 388T(S) Consciousness (W)
The nature of consciousness remains a fundamental mystery of the universe. Our internal, felt experience--what chocolate tastes like to oneself, what it is like to
see the color red, or, more broadly, what it is like to have a first person, waking perspective at all--resists explanation in any terms other than the conscious
experience itself in spite of centuries of intense effort by philosophers and, more recently, by scientists. As a result, some prominent researchers propose that the
existence of consciousness requires a revision of basic physics, while others (seemingly desperately) deny that consciousness exists at all. Those positions remain
extreme, but the challenge that consciousness poses is dramatic. It is at the same time the most intimately known fact of our humanity and science's most elusive
puzzle.
In this tutorial we will read the contemporary literature on consciousness. We will concentrate both on making precise the philosophical problem(s) of conscious-
ness and on understanding the role of the relevant neuroscientific and cognitive research. Tutorial partners will have an opportunity to spend the end of the
semester working on a special topic of their choosing including, for instance, consciousness and freewill, pain and anesthesia, consciousness and artificial intelli-
gence, or disorders of consciousness.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Participants will present substantial written work in the tutorial every other week, and will be responsible for commenting on their
tutorial partner's work on off weeks. Expect several short lectures by the instructor over the course of the semester where all the tutorial members convene.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 102 and at least one upper-level course in philosophy. Preference will be given to majors in Philosophy, or concentrators in Neurosci-
ence or Cognitive Science. Open to sophomores with permission of the instructor. Every effort will be made to pair students according to similar or complimenta-
ry background. This course is writing intensive. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10).

PHIL 389(S) The Structural-Systematic Philosophy
The history of theoretical inquiry since the seventeenth century is plausibly viewed as a process whereby philosophy, for the Greeks the home of virtually all
theoretical inquiry, is increasingly deprived of subject matters by the developments of the natural and social sciences. At an extreme, it can appear--and does
appear, to many philosophers--that philosophy is left with no proper subject matter except perhaps those sciences themselves. On a different view, however, this
process can appear instead as one that clarifies a proper subject matter for philosophy; that subject matter is the all-encompassing domain from which each natural
and social science carves its specific domain. Comprehensive philosophical treatments of this all-encompassing domain may reasonably be termed "theories of
everything." This seminar examines central components of such a theory that is currently under development; this is the structural-systematic philosophy present-
ed in Structure and Being (Lorenz Puntel, translated by collaboration with Alan White) and Toward a Philosophical Theory of Everything (Alan White). Among
the topics to be examined, as systematically interconnected, are language, knowledge, truth, mindedness, ethics, aesthetics, world history, God, being as such.
Format: seminar. Requirements: attendance, preparation, participation; regular short writing assignments and/or class presentations; a term paper (10-15 pages).
Prerequisites: Philosophy 102 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 8-12). Preference to Philosophy majors.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 MR WHITE
PHIL 393 Hegel: Freedom and History (Not offered 2009-2010)
Hegel pointed out that although freedom is one of our highest values, it is "open to the greatest misconceptions." This remains true today: although appeals to
freedom are used to justify governments, institutions, policies, and practices (and to sell cars, soft drinks, and rock-n-roll), those making and responding to such
appeals rarely thematize freedom explicitly, much less adequately. This has the ironic (and perhaps dangerous) consequence of making our culture one in which
people follow appeals to freedom unfreely, without knowing what freedom is or why it is worth pursuing.
This course will begin with the Philosophy of Right, in which Hegel critiques the most powerful "misconceptions" of freedom (those of liberalism and Kant), and
develops a new conception that grounds his own social and political philosophy. We will then read the Philosophy of History, in which Hegel interprets history as
the temporal process whereby humans come to understand their freedom and actualize it in the world.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two short papers, one longer paper, regular and active participation.
Prerequisites: Philosophy 101, or Philosophy 102. Enrollment limit: 25 (expected: 15). Preference given to Philosophy majors.

The instructional Physical Education Program at Williams is an integral part of the student's total educational experience. As a part of the liberal arts concept,
the program develops the mind -body relationship, which is dependent upon the proper integration of physical and intellectual capacities. The main objective of
the physical education program is to develop in each student an appreciation of physical fitness and wellness, and to expose them to a variety of activities that are
suitable for lifetime participation.
Four credits of Physical Education represent one of the requirements for the College degree. There are five physical education units during the year. In the fall
academic semester, there are two six-week physical education quarters. Winter Study is another unit, and there are two physical education quarters in the spring
academic semester. Two different activities must be completed.
The following courses are offered at various times during the year. A schedule listing all courses offered is issued to every student before each quarter and
Winter Study. Classes may vary according to availability of instructors and interest of students.

PHYSICS (Div. III)
Chair, Professor SARAH BOLTON
Professors: S. BOLTON, K. JONES, MAJUMDER*, STRAIT, WOOTTERS*. Associate Professors: AALBERTS*. Assistant Professors: LOPES,
STRAUCH, TUCKER-SMITH. Lecturer: BABCOCK. Laboratory Supervisor: FORKEY.
What is light? How does a transistor work? What is a black hole? Why are metals shiny? What is the wave/particle duality? There are people for whom
questions like these are of more than passing interest; some of them become Physics or Astrophysics majors. A physics student experiments with the phenomena
by which the physical world is known and explores the mathematical techniques and theories that make sense of it. A Physics or Astrophysics major serves as
preparation for further work in physics, astrophysics, applied physics, other sciences, engineering, medical research, science teaching and writing, and other
careers involving insight into the fundamental principles of nature.
ASTROPHYSICS MAJOR
The Physics Department, in cooperation with the Astronomy Department, offers a major in astrophysics consisting of (at least): 6 or 7 courses in Physics, 3 or 4
in Astronomy, and 1 in Mathematics. The core sequence of the Astrophysics major is the same as the Physics major described below (except that Physics 302,
although strongly recommended, is not required). Students intending to pursue graduate study in astrophysics will need to take upper-level physics electives
beyond the basic requirements for the major. Honors work in Astrophysics may be in either physics or astronomy. Students majoring in Astrophysics are expected
to consult early and often with faculty from both departments in determining their course selections. The detailed description of the Astrophysics major is given
under "Astronomy," along with a description of the Astronomy major also offered by that department (see page 73).
PHYSICS MAJOR
Introductory courses
Students considering a major in physics should take both physics and mathematics as first-year students. A student normally begins with either Physics 131 or
Physics 141:
1) Physics 131 Particles and Waves. This is designed as a first course in physics. It is suitable for students who either have not had physics before or have had
some physics but are not comfortable solving "word problems" that require calculus.
2) Physics 141 Particles and Waves--Enriched. Students in this course should have solid backgrounds in science and calculus, either from high school or
college, including at least a year of high school physics.
The Department of Mathematics will place students in the appropriate introductory calculus course. The physics major sequence courses all make use of
calculus at increasingly sophisticated levels. Therefore, students considering a Physics major should continue their mathematical preparation without interruption
through the introductory calculus sequence (Mathematics 103, 104, and 105 or 106). Students are encouraged to take Physics 210 as early as possible. Physics
210 is cross listed as Mathematics 210 for the benefit of those students who wish to have the course listed with a MATH prefix.
Advanced Placement
Students with unusually strong backgrounds in calculus and physics may place out of Physics 141 and either: 1) begin with the special seminar course Physics
151 in the fall (typically followed by Physics 210 in the spring), or 2) begin with Physics 142 in the spring (possibly along with Physics 210). Students may take
either 151 or 142 but not both. On rare occasions a student with an exceptional background will be offered the option of enrolling in Physics 201.
Placement is based on AP scores, consultation with the department, and results of a placement exam administered during First Days. The exam can also be
taken later in the year by arrangement with the department chair. The exam covers classical mechanics, basic wave phenomena, and includes some use of calculus
techniques.
Requirements for the Major
A total of ten courses in physics and mathematics are required to complete the Physics major. Students who place out of both Physics 141 and Physics
142 and begin their studies in Physics 201 are required to take a total of nine courses.
Required Physics Sequence Courses
Physics 141 Mechanics and Waves
or Physics 131 Introduction to Mechanics
Physics 142 Foundations of Modern Physics
or Physics 151 Seminar in Modern Physics
Physics 201 Electricity and Magnetism
Physics 202 Waves and Optics
Physics 210 Mathematical Methods for Scientists
Physics 301 Quantum Physics
Physics 302 Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics
Required Mathematics Course
Mathematics 105 Multivariable Calculus or Mathematics 106 Multivariable Calculus
Students entering with Advanced Placement in mathematics may obtain credit toward the major for the equivalent Mathematics 105 or 106 taken elsewhere.
At least two more physics or other approved courses must be taken, bringing the total number of courses for the major to ten.
Options
1) Mathematics 104 may be counted if taken at Williams
2) Mathematics 209 may substitute for Physics 210.
3) Astronomy 111 may count in place of Physics 141 if a student places out of 141 (see "advanced placement" above).
4) An additional Astronomy or Astrophysics course above the introductory level that is acceptable for the astrophysics major may be counted.
5) Two approved Division III courses above the introductory level may be substituted for one Physics course. Approval is on an individual basis at the
discretion of the department chair.
6) Honors work is in addition to completion of the basic major so Physics 493 and 494 do not count towards the ten courses in the major.
Preparation for Advanced Study
Students who may wish to do graduate work in physics, astrophysics, or engineering should elect courses in both physics and mathematics beyond the mini-
mum major requirements. The first-year graduate school curriculum in physics usually includes courses in quantum mechanics, electromagnetic theory, and
classical mechanics that presuppose intermediate level study of these subjects as an undergraduate. Therefore, students planning graduate work in physics should
elect all of the following courses:
Physics 402T Applications of Quantum Mechanics
Physics 405T Electromagnetic Theory
Physics 411T Classical Mechanics
Advising
Both majors and non-majors are encouraged to consult with the department chair or course instructors about course selections or other matters.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PHYSICS
The degree with honors in Physics will be awarded on the basis of a senior thesis presenting the results of a substantial experimental or theoretical investigation
carried out under the direction of a faculty member in the department. There is no rigid grade point average required for admission to the program or for the
awarding of the degree with honors, but it is normally expected that honors students will maintain at least a B average in physics and mathematics. Students will
normally apply for admission to the program early in the spring of their junior year and during senior year these students will normally elect Physics 493, W31,
and 494 in addition to the usual requirements for the major. At the end of winter study, the department will decide whether the student will be admitted to honors
candidacy. Both a written thesis and a colloquium presentation of the results are required. The degree with honors will be awarded to those who meet these
requirements with distinction. The degree with highest honors will be awarded to those who fulfill them with unusually high distinction.
Honors candidates will also be required to participate in departmental colloquium talks.
STUDY ABROAD
The physics community is international in scope and a career in physics (or a related field) can provide many opportunities for travel and contact with individu-
als from outside the United States. The physics major at Williams is a carefully structured four-year program designed to prepare students who are so inclined for
230
graduate study at leading research institutions. While it is possible to complete the major requirements in three years, such a major will not usually not lead to
further study in the field. With careful early planning on the part of a student, and close consultation with the department chair, it is possible to complete a strong
major and still study abroad provided the foreign institution can provide courses which reasonably substitute or supplement those in the Williams major program.
OPTIONS FOR NON-MAJORS
Many students want to take a self-contained and rigorous full-year survey of physics. For such students, the most appropriate sequence will be either Physics
131 or Physics 141 followed by Physics 132, depending on the student's background in science and mathematics (see Introductory Courses above). Either of
these sequences satisfies the physics requirement for medical school.
The department also offers one semester courses designed for non-majors. This year there are three such offerings: Physics 107, 108 and Physics 109.
PHYS 107 Newton, Einstein, and Beyond (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
This course follows a quest to understand the nature of space, time, matter, and energy, one that continues to this day. We will focus on two scientific theories that
revolutionized our understanding of the physical world, Newtonian mechanics (developed in the late 17th century) and Einstein's special relativity (developed in
the early 20th century). As we explore these theories, we will pay special attention to the very different stories they tell about space and time. We will conclude the
semester by touching upon recent developments in cosmology, where observations have led to dramatic surprises about the make-up of our universe, and particle
physics, where the Large Hadron Collider experiment is poised to extend our understanding of nature to higher energies and shorter distances.
This course is intended for students whose primary interests lie outside of the natural sciences and mathematics. The mathematics used will be algebra and
trigonometry. Every student will have three meetings every week. Some weeks the three meetings will be lectures (MWF 10-10:50), other weeks there will be
two lectures (MF 10-10:50), and one conference section.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; problem-solving conference section, one hour per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, quizzes, two
midterms, and a final exam, all with a significant quantitative component (see the description of the QFR requirement).
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 100 (expected: 70). Preference given to students based on seniority.
TUCKER-SMITH
PHYS 108(S) Energy Science and Technology (Same as Environmental Studies 108) (Q)
Energy use has skyrocketed in the United States and elsewhere in the world, causing significant economic and political shifts, as well as concerns for the environ-
ment. This course will address the physics and technology of energy generation, consumption, and conservation. It will cover a wide range of energy sources,
including fossil fuels, hydropower, solar energy, wind energy, and nuclear energy. We will discuss energy use in transportation, manufacturing, building heating,
and building lighting. Students will learn to compare the efficiencies and environmental impacts of various energy sources and uses.
Format: lecture once a week plus weekly conference section. Evaluation will be based on weekly assignments, two hour tests, and a final project. All of these will
be substantially quantitative.
Prerequisites: high school physics, high school chemistry, and mathematics at the level of Mathematics 103. This course will make use of quantitative arguments
and an acquaintance with high school physics and chemistry will prove helpful. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 30).
Hour: 1:10-2:25 M Conferences: 1:10-2:25 R, 2:35-3:50 R STRAIT
PHYS 109 Sound, Light, and Perception (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
Light and sound allow us to perceive the world around us, from appreciating music and art to learning the details of atomic structure. Because of their importance
in human experience, light and sound have long been the subject of scientific inquiry. How are sound and light related? How do physiology and neural processing
allow us to hear and see the world around us? What are the origins of color and musical pitch? This course introduces the science and technology of light and
sound to students not majoring in physics. We will start with the origins of sound and light as wave phenomena, and go on to topics including color, the optics of
vision, the meaning of musical pitch and tone, and the physical basis of hearing. We will also discuss some recent technological applications of light, such as
lasers and optical communications. The class will meet for two 75-minute periods each week for a variable mixture of lecture, discussion, and hands-on, interac-
tive experiments.
Format: lecture/lab/discussion. Each student will attend the Thursday lecture plus one conference section weekly. Evaluation will be based on class participation,
problem sets, in-class exams, oral presentations, and a final exam, all with a quantitative component.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 40 (expected: 40).
MAJUMDER
PHYS 131(F) Introduction to Mechanics (Q)
We focus first on the Newtonian mechanics of point particles: the relationship between velocity, acceleration, and position; the puzzle of circular motion; forces;
Newton's laws; energy and momentum; and gravitation. The physics of extended objects and of fluids also will be discussed briefly. We finally turn to the basic
properties of waves, such as interference and polarization, with emphasis on light waves. This course is intended for students who have not studied physics before
or who have had some physics, but are not comfortable solving "word problems" that require calculus. Students who scored 4 or 5 on the AP Physics B exam or
on the AP Physics C (mechanics) exam, or 6 or 7 on the IB Physics HL exam may not take this course. These students and others with strong backgrounds in the
sciences are encouraged to consider taking Physics 141 instead. Physics 131 can lead to either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or
Physics 142 (for students considering a physics or astrophysics major).
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, hour tests, labs, and a final
exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 103. No enrollment limit (expected: 60).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W BOLTON
PHYS 132(S) Electromagnetism and the Physics of Matter (Q)
This course is intended as the second half of a one-year survey of physics. In the first half of the semester we will focus on electromagnetic phenomena. We will
introduce the concept of electric and magnetic fields, and study in detail the way in which electrical circuits and circuit elements work. The deep connection
between electric and magnetic phenomena is highlighted in a discussion of Faraday's Law of Induction. In the second half of the semester, we introduce several of
the most central topics in twentieth-century physics. We will discuss Einstein's theory of special relativity as well as aspects of quantum theory. We will end with a
treatment of nuclear physics, radioactivity, and uses of radiation.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, labs, hour tests, and a final
exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.

Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 M,T,W STRAUCH
PHYS 141(F) Mechanics and Waves (Q)
This course covers the same topics as Physics 131, but with a higher level of mathematical sophistication and more emphasis on waves. It is intended for students
with solid backgrounds in the sciences, either from high school or college, who feel comfortable solving "word problems" that require calculus. Physics 141 can
lead to either Physics 132 (for students wanting a one-year survey of physics) or Physics 142 (for students considering a physics or astrophysics major).
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week/conference, one hour every other week. Evaluation will be based on weekly
problem sets, quizzes and hour tests, and labs, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: high school physics and Mathematics 103 (or equivalent placement). No enrollment limit (expected: 50).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 W,R LOPES
PHYS 142(S) Foundations of Modern Physics (Q)
The twentieth century was an extremely productive and exciting time for physics. Special relativity has extended physics into the realm of high speeds and high
energies. Quantum mechanics has successfully described phenomena at small energies and small distance scales. Our understanding of atoms, molecules, and
solids has developed from a few revolutionary ideas into a sophisticated framework which today supports technologies that were unimagined in 1900. This
course will introduce many important developments in physics, including special relativity, Schrodinger's wave mechanics, the quantum mechanical understand-
ing of the periodic table and the theory of energy bands in solids.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours every other week; conference, one hour every other week. Evaluation will be based on weekly
homework, labs, two hour tests, and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 141 and Mathematics 103, or equivalent; students may not take both Physics 142 and Physics 151. Physics 131 may substitute for Physics
141 with the permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected:30).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 T,W JONES
PHYS 151(F) Seminar in Modern Physics (Q)
Why does a hot coal glow red rather than blue or green or some other color? Remarkably, this simple question could not be answered before the year 1900,
because the answer depends on a radical assumption introduced in that year by Max Planck. His work on thermal radiation marked the beginning of a revolution-
ary era in the history of physics that culminated in a new framework for our understanding of the physical world. Relativity, quantum mechanics, and statistical
physics are the pillars of the modern framework, and constitute the core of this course. As we study this material, we will also be exploring the process of research
231
in physics, partly by doing some experiments of our own. We will discuss the interaction between experiment and theory, as well as the roles of simplicity,
elegance, and unity in the search for explanations. This is a small seminar designed for first-year students who have placed out of Physics 141.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, every other week. Evaluation will be based on class participation, labs, weekly problem sets, an oral
presentation, two hour-exams and a final exam, all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: placement by the department (see "advanced placement" section in the description about the department ). Students may take either Physics 142 or
Physics 151 but not both. Enrollment limit: 18 (expected: 18).
Hour: 11:00-11:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 W TUCKER-SMITH
PHYS 201(F) Electricity and Magnetism (Q)
In this course, we study electromagnetic phenomena and their mathematical description. Topics include electrostatics, magnetic fields, and electromagnetic in-
duction, DC and AC circuits, and the electromagnetic properties of matter. We also introduce Maxwell's equations, which express the essence of the theory in
remarkably succinct form.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, labs, two hour tests, and a final exam, all of
which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 142, Mathematics 105 or 106. No enrollment limit (expected:25).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 T,W STRAIT
PHYS 202(S) Waves and Optics (Q)
Waves and oscillations characterize many different physical systems, including vibrating strings, springs, water waves, sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and
gravitational waves. Quantum mechanics even describes particles with wave functions. Despite these diverse settings waves exhibit several common characteris-
tics, so that the understanding of a few simple systems can provide insight into a wide array of phenomena. In this course we begin with the study of oscillations of
simple systems with only a few degrees of freedom. We then move on to study transverse and longitudinal waves in continuous media in order to gain a general
description of wave behavior. The rest of the course focuses on electromagnetic waves and in particular on optical examples of wave phenomena. In addition to
well known optical effects such as interference and diffraction, we will study a number of modern applications of optics such as short pulse lasers and optical
communications. Throughout the course mathematical methods useful for higher-level physics will be introduced.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on problem sets, labs, two one-hour tests, and a final exam, all of
which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisite: Physics 201. Co-requisite: Physics/Mathematics 210 or permission of instructor. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).
Hour: 10:00-10:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 W,R LOPES
PHYS 210(S) Mathematical Methods for Scientists (Same as Mathematics 210) (Q)
This course covers a variety of mathematical methods used in the sciences, focusing particularly on the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations. In
addition to calling attention to certain special equations that arise frequently in the study of waves and diffusion, we develop general techniques such as looking
for series solutions and, in the case of nonlinear equations, using phase portraits and linearizing around fixed points. We study some simple numerical techniques
for solving differential equations. A series of optional sessions in Mathematica will be offered for students who are not already familiar with this computational
tool.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets and several in-class exams, all of which have a substantial quantitative
component.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 105 or 106 and familiarity with Newtonian mechanics at the level of Physics 131. No enrollment limit (expected: 20).
Hour: 9:55-11:10 TR TUCKER-SMITH
PHYS 301(F) Quantum Physics (Q)
This course serves as a one-semester introduction to the history, formalism, and phenomenology of quantum mechanics. We begin with a discussion of the
historical origins of the quantum theory, and the Schroedinger wave equation. The concepts of matter waves and wave-packets are introduced. Solutions to
one-dimensional problems will be treated prior to introducing the system which serves as a hallmark of the success of quantum theory, the three-dimensional
hydrogen atom. In the second half of the course, we will develop the important connection between the underlying mathematical formalism and the physical
predictions of the quantum theory. We then go on to apply this knowledge to several important problems within the realm of atomic and nuclear physics.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, labs, a midterm exam, and final exam,
all of which have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 202 and Physics 210. No enrollment limit (expected:15).
Hour: 9:00-9:50 MWF Lab: 1-4 T,W JONES
PHYS 302(S) Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics (Q)
You understand the interactions among fundamental particles (Newton's and Coulomb's laws, the Schrodinger equation, etc.) but how do these interactions
determine the behavior of macroscopic objects, which are made up of huge numbers of such particles? This is a rather critical question for understanding the
world around us. In this course we will develop the tools of statistical physics, which will allow us to predict the cooperative phenomena that emerge in large
ensembles of interacting particles. We will apply those tools to a wide variety of physical questions, including the behavior of gasses, heat engines, magnets, and
electrons in solids.
Format: lecture/discussion, three hours per week; laboratory, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, exams, and labs, all of which
have a substantial quantitative component.
Prerequisites: Physics 142, Physics 210, Physics 301. No enrollment limit (expected: 15).

PHYS 315 Computational Biology (Same as Computer Science 315 and INTR 315) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
This course will provide an overview of Computational Biology, the application of computational, mathematical, and physical problem-solving techniques to
interpret the rapidly expanding amount of biological data. Topics covered will include database searching, DNA sequence alignment, phylogeny reconstruction,
RNA and protein structure prediction, microarray analysis, and genome assembly using techniques such as string matching, dynamic programming, suffix trees,
hidden Markov models, and expectation-maximization.
Format: lecture, three hours per week; laboratory, 1.5 hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, programming assignments, and a few
quizzes.
Prerequisites: programming experience (e.g. CSCI 136), mathematics (PHYS 210 or MATH 105), and physical science (PHYS 142 or 151, or CHEM 151 or 153
or 155), or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15). Preference given to students based on seniority.
AALBERTS
PHYS 316 Protecting Information: Applications of Abstract Algebra and Quantum Physics (Same as Mathematics 316) (Not offered
2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (Q)
Living in the early decades of the information age, we find ourselves depending more and more on codes that protect messages against either noise or eavesdrop-
ping. We begin this course by studying the history of this subject, including, for example, the story of the enigma code from World War II. We then examine some
of the most important codes currently being used to protect information, including linear codes, which in addition to being mathematically elegant are the most
practical codes for error correction, and the RSA public key cryptographic scheme, popular nowadays for internet applications. Looking ahead by a decade or
more, we show how a "quantum computer" could crack any RSA code in short order, and how quantum cryptographic devices will achieve security through the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
Evaluation will be based on homework sets and exams.
Prerequisites: Physics 210 or Mathematics 211 (possibly concurrent) or permission of the instructors. (Students not satisfying the course prerequisites but who
have completed Mathematics 209 or Mathematics 251 are particularly encouraged to ask to be admitted.)

PHYS 405T(F) Electromagnetic Theory (Q)
We will review Maxwell's equations and use them to study a range of topics--electric fields and matter, magnetic materials, light, radiation--exploring phenom-
ena and seeking to gain an intuitive understanding. We will also learn some useful approximation techniques and some beautiful mathematical tools.
The class will meet as a whole once per week for an hour lecture on new material and to discuss questions on the readings. Each week a second tutorial meeting
with the instructor will be scheduled; here, students will take turns working problems on the chalkboard. Written solutions to problems will be due a few days after
the tutorial meeting.

The course will investigate advanced topics in classical mechanics including phase space plots, non-linear oscillators, numerical solutions, approximation meth-
ods, the calculus of variations, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian reformulations of mechanics, rotating frames of reference (with emphasis on the implications for
physics on the Earth) and scattering cross sections. The carry over of ideas developed in the context of classical mechanics into other areas of physics will be
explored. The class as a whole will meet once per week for an introductory lecture/discussion. A second tutorial meeting between the instructor and a pair of
students will be scheduled later in the week. Students will take turns working and discussing problems at the chalkboard. Written solutions will be due later in the

STRAUCH
PHYS 418(S) Gravity (Q)
This course is an introduction to the currently accepted theory of gravity, Einstein's general theory of relativity. We begin with a review of special relativity,
emphasizing geometrical aspects of Minkowski spacetime. Working from the equivalence principle, we then motivate gravity as spacetime curvature, and study
in detail the Schwarzschild geometry around a spherically symmetric mass, and the Friedmann-Robertson Walker geometries for an expanding universe. After
these applications, we use tensors to develop Einstein's equation, which describes how energy density curves spacetime, and finally, starting from a linearized
version of this equation, we develop the theory of gravitational waves.
Format: lecture, three hours per week. Evaluation will be based on weekly problem sets, a midterm exam, and a final exam, all with a substantial quantitative
component.
Prerequisites: Physics 301 or Physics 405 or Physics 411 (students with strong math backgrounds are invited to consult with the instructor about a possible
waiving of the prerequisites.) No enrollment limit (expected: 19).

POLITICAL ECONOMY (Div. II)
Chair, Professor DAREL E. PAUL
Advisory Committee: Professors: BAKIJA, S. SHEPPARD, MAHON. Associate Professors: MELLOW, PAUL.
The Political Economy major is designed to give students a grasp of the ways in which political and economic forces interact in the shaping of public policy.
The major includes substantial study of the central analytical approaches in both political science and economics and seeks to surmount the sometimes artificial
barriers of specialization that may characterize either discipline taken by itself. The three required Political Economy courses undertake a conscious merging of
the approaches in the two fields. (These courses are designed by, and usually are taught jointly by, political scientists and economists.) Political Economy 250
(formerly POEC 301) examines major writings in political economy and analyzes economic liberalism and critiques of economic liberalism in the context of
current policy issues. Political Economy 401 examines interactions of international and domestic forces in contemporary issues. Political Economy 402 asks
students to research and make proposals in policy areas of current importance. Background for these senior courses is acquired through courses in international
economics, public finance, and domestic and international/comparative politics and policy.
Students in Political Economy 402 visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of the first week of spring vacation to conduct interviews relating
to their Political Economy 402 group projects. This is a course requirement and thus a requirement for the major.

(Note: Beginning with the class of 2012, Political Economy majors must complete one course with a substantial experiential education compo-
nent, related to public policy. In 2009-10, these courses include ENVI 302 and POEC 020 (WSP) as well as PSCI 021 and other WSP courses
not yet listed. Winter Study 99's or experiential work done in a study abroad program could also qualify, with the prior permission of the POEC

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY
Due to the special demands of this interdisciplinary major, the only route to honors in Political Economy is the thesis. Seniors may pursue the honors thesis
course (Political Economy 493-W31) during the fall semester and winter study period. The third course contributing to such an honors program would normally
be an elective in Political Science or Economics taken during the junior year. This course, which may be one of the required electives, must be closely related,
indeed must prepare the ground for the honors thesis.
Juniors in the Political Economy major with at least a 3.5 GPA in the program may apply for the honors thesis program by means of a written proposal
submitted to the chair before spring registration. Written guidelines for such proposals are available in the chair's office or on the program website. The proposal
should have been discussed with at least two faculty members, and at least one faculty advisor from each discipline should be solicited by the student prior to
submission of the proposal.
Final decisions about admission to the honors program will be made in early summer, when spring grades become available.
To achieve the degree with honors in Political Economy, the thesis must be completed by the end of winter study period and be judged of honors quality by a
committee consisting of the two advisors and a third reader. A thesis judged to be of particular distinction will qualify its author for the degree with highest honors.
STUDY ABROAD
Despite the fact that Political Economy requires more courses than the typical major, plenty of Political Economy majors go abroad. Since many students take
POEC 250 in the fall of the junior year, if you're thinking of spending only one semester abroad, Spring is the better choice. But lots of students go away for the
Fall or the whole year. Political Economy majors have often been overrepresented in Williams at Oxford. If you do go abroad in the fall, you may take POEC 250
in your sophomore or senior years. The former is preferable. You'll probably want to get some major credits when abroad. The easiest to get are upper-level
electives in political science and economics. Most programs for US students in Europe have a political science course on the EU, which is a good fit. We recom-
mend against taking econometrics abroad.
COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM
The numbering system for courses offered and required in Political Economy is identical to the system outlined on page 30.
POEC 250(F) (formerly 301) Economic Liberalism and Its Critics (Same as Economics 299 and Political Science 238)
Economic liberalism holds that society is better off if people enjoy economic freedom. Its critics point to what they believe this position ignores or what it wrongly
assumes, and hence, how it would make bad policy. This course explores the relationship between politics and economics by surveying influential works of
political economy. Its first part examines major thinkers in relation to the historical development of capitalism in Western Europe and the United States: the
classical liberalism of Adam Smith, Karl Marx's revolutionary socialism, and the reformist ideas of John Stuart Mill, R. H. Tawney, and John Maynard Keynes.
234
The second part considers more recent writings that revise and critique liberalism from a variety of perspectives. The historical focus of the course permits you to
appreciate the ongoing dialogue between classical and contemporary views of political economy, while classroom discussion involves frequent reference to
current public policy issues.
Format: discussion/lecture. Requirements: eight 2-page papers and a final exam.
Prerequisites: one course in Economics and either Political Science 201 or 203 or AP credit in American Politics (or permission of instructor). Enrollment limit:
35 (expected: 32). Preference given to Political Economy majors and sophomores intending a Political Economy major.
Required in the Political Economy major but open to non-majors.

Open to juniorsorseniors majoring inPolitical Economy, with approval ofafacultysupervisor and the chair.
POEC 401(F) Contemporary Problems in Political Economy
This course examines contemporary problems in political economy at and across diverse spatial scales. Using both Economics and Political Science methods of
analysis, we will study the exercise of power and the accumulation of wealth in the world today as well as central public policy debates around those processes.
We begin with a sweeping historical overview of the past century. Then we move through three course sections organized around contemporary problems at three
distinct scales: the global political economy, the United States political economy, and comparative political economy with an emphasis on the advanced capitalist
countries. The goal of this course is both to build upon theoretical debates encountered in POEC 250 as well as to prepare students for the public policy analysis
they will do in POEC 402.
Format: seminar. Requirements: three 8- to 10-page papers; one 12- to 15-page paper revision.
Prerequisites: Economics 110 and 120; Political Science 202 or 204, or equivalent. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 15). Preference given to Political Economy
majors. Required in the Political Economy major but open to non-majors.
Hour: 1:10-2:25 TF ROLLEIGH and PAUL
POEC 402(S) Political Economy of Public Policy Issues
The core of this course consists of analyses by student study groups of current issues of public policy. The student groups investigate the interacting political and
economic aspects of an issue, do extensive reading, conduct interviews in Washington (during spring recess) with public and private officials, write a major report
on their findings and recommendations, and defend it orally in a public session.
Students visit Washington, D.C. Sunday night through Wednesday of the first week of spring vacation to conduct interviews relating to their group projects. This
is a course requirement.
Format: seminar with student presentations.
Prerequisites: Economics 253 or 255; satisfaction of the U.S. Political Economy and Public Policy course requirement (see list of major requirements above),
prior or concurrently.
Required in the major and open only to Political Economy majors.

POLITICAL SCIENCE (Div. II)
Chair, Professor JAMES E. MAHON
Professors: CRANE, C. JOHNSON*, MACDONALD, MAHON, MARCUS, MCALLISTER, M. REINHARDT, SHANKS, A. WILLINGHAM.
Associate Professors: M. DEVEAUX*, MELLOW, PAUL. Assistant Professors: CROWE, P. MACDONALD, MUNEMO. W. Ford Schumann

Politics is most fundamentally about forging and maintaining community, about how we manage to craft a common destiny guided by shared values. Commu-
nities need a way to reconcile conflicts of interest among their members and to determine their group interest; they need to allocate power and to determine its just
uses. Power may be used wisely or foolishly, rightly or cruelly, but it is always there; it cannot be wished away. Political science attends to the ways that social
power is grasped, maintained, challenged, or justified. The contests over power and the values that it should be used to further give politics its drama and pathos.
The effort to understand politics aims not only to describe and explain, but also to improve political life.
The Political Science major is structured to allow students either to participate in the established ways of studying politics or to develop their own foci. To this
end, the department offers two routes to completing the major, each requiring nine courses. We invite students either to organize their major through the subfields
that structure the discipline of political science (American politics, international relations, political theory, and comparative politics), or to develop individual
concentrations reflecting their particular interests, regardless of subfields.
MAJOR
SUBFIELD CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Upon declaring a major, students choose one subfield: American politics, international relations, political theory, or
comparative politics. The subfield concentration draws at least four (4) of the nine courses from one subfield including the appropriate core course from 201-204,
two electives of the student's choice at the 200 or 300 level and the senior seminar (or an individual project) in the student's subfield. Students selecting political
theory as their subfield concentration must take Political Science 231 or Political Science 232 as one of their four subfield courses, in addition to taking Political
Science 203 and prior to taking Political Science 430. (A degree with honors in Political Science requires enrollment in the year-long senior thesis seminar, which
does not count toward the nine (9) major requirements.) With permission of the department chair, students may take a senior seminar in a different subfield,
providing they take a third elective in the subfield of concentration. In addition, students must take courses in two subfields outside the subfield of concentration to
satisfy the breadth requirement (all courses at the 100 level and all methods courses also count toward the breadth requirement). The faculty advisor and the
department chair must approve the student plan. Beginning with the class of 2011, all students must take at least one 300-level course and one research course to
complete the major. In addition, no more than one 100-level course can count toward the major.
INDIVIDUAL CONCENTRATION ROUTE: Alternatively, students may devise a concentration of their own. In this event, the student prepares a curricular
plan in consultation with a faculty advisor, explaining the nature of the concentration and the courses the student will take. The individual concentration also
requires nine (9) courses, with at least five (5) thematically linked courses constituting the concentration. Of these five courses, four are electives at the 200 or 300
level, including one from 201-204, and one is a senior seminar or individual project. In addition, students pursuing an individual concentration must take at least
two other courses that illustrate breadth in political science. To complete the requirement, the student has his or her choice of any two other courses within the
Political Science Department. The faculty advisor and the department chair must approve the student plan.
ADVISEMENT
When a student chooses to major in Political Science (usually at the end of the sophomore year), he or she may register with any Political Science faculty
member at the designated time and places. The registering faculty member will ask for preferences for a permanent faculty advisor and will assist undecided
students in finding an advisor. In all cases, students will be paired by the end of the sophomore year with an advisor who will continue with them through gradua-
tion.
COURSE NUMBERING
The course numbering used by the Political Science Department reflects the format and specialization of a course The 100-level courses are designed to
address political topics from multiple subfield perspectives. The 200-level courses are divided between our core courses and our electives. The core courses,
numbered from 201-204, serve as introductions both to the substance of the politics and the subfields organizing the study of politics. The introductory subfield
course must be completed before the senior year. The 200-level elective courses delve into political processes, problems and philosophies. 100-level and 200-lev-
el courses have no prerequisites. 300-level courses are more specialized and require prerequisites. 400-level courses are senior seminars offered for students in the

WINTER STUDY PROJECT
The department welcomes relevant WSP 99 proposals that can make important contributions to the student's understanding of public affairs and politics.
Majors, seniors, and students without previous WSP 99 experience have preference.
THE JUNIOR YEAR ABROAD
A major in Political Science can be readily and usefully combined with study in a foreign country. No more than one course taken per semester abroad in a
program approved by the College may be counted toward the requirements for a degree in Political Science.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE
The Political Science Department grants honors to candidates who, (1) complete the Senior Seminar, (2) receive at least a grade of 3.50 on a Senior Thesis
(493-W31-494), and (3) have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in Political Science.
To become a candidate for honors the student must (1) apply in the second semester of the junior year, (2) submit a research proposal acceptable to the depart-
ment's honors committee and for which an appropriate advisor is available, and (3) have a minimum GPA of 3.5 in Political Science for the first six semesters.
(Political Science 493-W31-494 DO NOT count toward the total of nine required of all majors.)
ADVANCED STUDY IN AMERICAN POLITICS
The Department of Political Science provides the opportunity for an unusually gifted student to engage in an entire year's advanced research in American
politics under singularly favorable conditions. Supported by income derived from an endowment fund, the student, designated the Sentinels of the Republic
Scholar (after the name of the fund), receives a substantial research stipend to cover costs associated with the proposed project.
This unique research course (Political Science 481-W33-482) is designed to encourage the pursuit of excellence among the most talented Williams students of
Political Science. Admission to it is awarded to the most distinguished candidate on the basis of demonstrated capacity for outstanding work and of the project's
promise for creative contributions to the understanding of American politics, political institutions and thought.

Asia looms large in contemporary world politics: Japan is gradually assuming an expanded regional national security role; The People's Republic of China is
emerging as a multifaceted Great Power; India is challenged by rising ethno-nationalism. This course will explore both the historical background and current
dynamics of political and economic issues in these three countries, drawing on themes of imperialism, nationalism, and globalization. It is an introductory class
and, therefore, no prior coursework in political science or Asian studies is necessary.

PSCI 102 Religion and Capitalism (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
While most observers up through the 1960s expected the advance of modern capitalist social relations to usher in a lasting world-wide era of secularism, over the
last forty years much of the world has instead experienced a dramatic revival of religion to social, economic and political importance. What is the relationship
between these two signature forces of religion and capitalism--one ideal, one material--which have constructed and continue to define our cultures, economies
and polities? This course is an investigation into this question, with its touchstone being the famous `Weber thesis'--namely, that Protestant ideas and ethics gave
rise to capitalist society. Using Max Weber as well as his critics as a foundation, the course emphasizes recent historical and contemporary questions, such as: why
are welfare states in Catholic countries different from those in Protestant countries? Does Confucianism make Asian capitalism different from Western forms?
Does consumerism function as a `secular religion'? Why is Pentecostalism increasingly prevalent in third world slums? Is the rise of contemporary religious
`fundamentalism' a response to globalization? For reasons of history and analytic focus, the course emphasizes the interaction between capitalism and Christian-
ity, although non-Christian religions--particularly Confuciansim--will also be discussed.
Format: seminar. Requirements: one medium-length paper, two short papers, one long research paper incorporating the prior three papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected 16). Open to first-year students and sophomores only.

PSCI 120(S) America and the World After September 11
The terrorist attacks of September 11 and the war in Afghanistan raised fundamental questions about the past and future course of American foreign policy. While
virtually no one defended the terrorist attacks, many academics argued that the root causes of September 11th were to be found in the flaws of the American
236
approach to the world. In this view, America is an arrogant, unilateralist country that ignores the views and perspectives of the rest of the world community, relies
far too much on its overwhelming military power, and often acts against its ideals and values by supporting repressive and unpopular regimes. This course has
three primary objectives. First, we will assess important critiques of contemporary American foreign policy from both the left and right of the political spectrum.
Second, we will examine the historical and intellectual background of both supporters and critics of American foreign policy in the post Vietnam War era. Third,
in the aftermath of September 11 we will attempt to answer the most important question of all for any analysis of American foreign policy: What is to be done?
While current issues of American foreign policy will be addressed in this class, potential students should note that its primary focus is not on the technical/military
elements of combating terrorism.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: assignments will include weekly response papers, two 5- to 7-page papers, and a comprehensive in-class final exam.
Students will also be required to obtain (free) online subscriptions to the New York Times and other current periodicals.

PSCI 201(F,S) Power, Politics, and Democracy in America
Begun as an experiment over 200 years ago, the United States has grown into a polity that is simultaneously praised and condemned, critiqued and mythologized,
modeled by others and remodeled itself. This course introduces students to the dynamics and tensions that have animated the American political order and that
have nurtured these conflicting assessments. Topics include the founding of the American system and the primary documents (the Declaration of Independence,
the Constitution, and the Federalist Papers), the primary institutions of national government then and now (Congress, the Presidency, and the Supreme Court) and
the politics of policy-making in the United States. We study structures, processes, key events, and primary actors that have shaped American political develop-
ment. In investigating these topics, we explore questions such as these: How is power allocated? What produces political change? Is there is a trade-off between
democratic accountability and effective governance? How are tensions between liberty and equality resolved? Do the institutions produce good policies, and how
do we define what is good?

PSCI 202(F,S) World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations
International politics differs from domestic politics in the absence of centralized, legitimate institutions. Anarchy characterizes the world of sovereign states-there
is no world government, nor agreement that one is desirable or even possible. This lack of a common authority means that any dispute among countries is up to
the countries themselves to settle, by negotiating, appealing to shared norms, or using force. For this reason, while international relations involves many of the
same topics that consume domestic politics-ethnic antagonisms, spending on aid, war, national identity, inequality, weapons manufacture, finance, loans, pollu-
tion, migration-it shares few of the same processes for dealing with them. This course covers problems central to international relations. It considers the impor-
tance that this radical decentralization has for achieving values we hold, and examines processes that might undermine or support the anarchical system in which
we live.
Format: lecture. Requirements: first semester: midterm paper or exam, final exam, four short papers and class participation; second semester: two midterm ex-

PSCI 203(F,S) Introduction to Political Theory
Is politics war by other means? Is it merely a practical way to meet our needs? Or is it, rather, the activity through which citizens pursue justice and the good life?
And what is justice? How can it be established and secured? What are the powers and obligations of citizenship? Who should rule? Who decides? On what basis?
Political theory addresses questions such as these as it investigates the fundamental problems of how we can, do, and ought to live together. The questions have
sparked controversy since the origins of political thinking; the answers remain controversial now. This course addresses the controversies, focusing on major
works of ancient, modern, and contemporary theory by such authors as Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Rousseau, Hegel, Mill, Marx, Nietzsche, Arendt,
Rawls, and Foucault. Themes may include authority, obligation, power, war, violence, freedom, justice, equality, democracy, liberalism, capitalism, community,
and pluralism, though the emphasis will vary from semester to semester.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two or three papers; some sections also have a final exam.

PSCI 204(F) Introduction to Comparative Politics: State, Nation, and Democracy
Whereas the field of international relations focuses upon the actions of sovereign states toward one another, the comparative study of politics looks mainly at what
goes on inside countries. It asks, for example, why political life differs so much from one country to another, how political regimes change, sometimes suddenly,
and where sovereign states come from. Thus comparative politics is often about what citizens of countries with stable and relatively effective governments take
for granted.
In the fall section, we will focus on several broad historical-political themes: the rise of modern state structures; the articulation of national identities; and the
political-economic dynamics of democratization. Analysis will draw on the experiences of several different countries in Europe, Asia and Africa.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two 5-page papers and a final exam.

goes on inside countries. It asks, for example, why political life differs so much from one country to another, how political regimes change, sometimes suddenly,
and where sovereign states come from. Thus comparative politics is often about what citizens of countries with stable and relatively effective governments take

In the spring section, we first read influential works of modern social thought and contemporary political science, as well as stories and novels, in order to ask
general questions about the relationship between politics and economic development, the origins of revolution, nationalism, and terrorism, and the effects of war
and religion on politics. We then clarify some of these ideas as we briefly consider the USA in comparative perspective. The course ends with short student
projects applying key concepts to particular countries.

PSCI 207 Political Elections (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Elections in American politics are dynamic events in which many different groups struggle to gain control of political institutions at the local, state, and federal
levels. During the campaigns, candidates and their supporters move across the land, appearing on television and radio, and through the printed press. Simulta-
neously, various organizations and interest groups attempt to gain influence with the candidates and with public opinion by raising money, making endorsements,
running political appeals in the various media, and supplying activists to work for the candidates they favor. This course explores the factors that shape the
outcome of political elections in America. Among the factors we will consider are the state of the economy, international events, the role of political parties at the
state and national levels, the current partisan balance, ideology, media, special interests, money, candidates, the "hot" issues of the moment and long enduring
issues, campaign debates, and campaign polling and public opinion. We will consider in detail the 2006 national mid-term elections both for Federal office
(President, Senate and House) and for state offices (governors, state legislators).

PSCI 211(F) Public Opinion and Political Behavior
The focus of this course is the role of public opinion in democratic regimes. The influence of public opinion on public affairs and popular governments is a
relatively new phenomenon in the history of governments (largely subsequent to the American and French revolutions). We can see from recent events the impact
of public opinion: In the early 1990s the American public quickly became interested in drought and starvation in Somalia pressing the American government to
intervene, if briefly and unsuccessfully. Some have claimed that American journalists successfully provoked the American public to go to war (the Spanish-
American War, creating the slogan, "Remember the Maine"), and to withdraw from war (Viet Nam). More recently, public support to commence the Iraq war was
generated in the United States while at the same time democratic publics in other nations strongly opposed the war. We see political leaders make use of the"bully
pulpit" to rally support for their agendas, efforts that sometimes succeed and other times fail. We shall explore public opinion in American politics. There are
many interesting questions awaiting us this semester. How do events and crises influence public opinion? Which psychological, sociological, and political factors
impact public opinion formation? When and under what circumstances do pressure groups influence public opinion? Do mass beliefs alter individual voters'
choices? When and how do political leaders influence public opinion and when does public opinion influence political leaders?
Format: lecture/discussion. In addition, we will have direct access to the holdings of the Roper Center, using iPOLL, which enables direct exploration of the
thousands of polls on American public opinion from 1937 to today. Requirements: 8- to 12-page research paper, a midterm and final examination.

How has the American Constitution been debated and understood over time? What is the relationship between constitutional and political change? This course
examines the historical development of American constitutional law and politics from the Founding to the present. Our focus is on structures of power--the limits
on congressional lawmaking, growth of presidential authority, establishment of judicial review, conflicts among the three branches of the federal government, and
boundaries between the federal and state and local governments. The specific disputes under these rubrics range from secession to impeachment, gun control to
child labor, waging war to spurring commerce; the historical periods to be covered include the Marshall and Taney Court years, the Civil War and Reconstruction,
the Progressive era, the New Deal, the Warren Court, and the conservative ascendancy of the late twentieth century. Readings are drawn from Supreme Court
opinions, presidential addresses, congressional debates and statutes, political party platforms, key tracts of American political thought, and secondary scholarship
on constitutional development. Throughout the semester, our goal will be less to remember elaborate doctrinal rules and multi-part constitutional "tests" than to
understand the changing nature of, and changing relationship between, constitutional power and constitutional meaning in American history.

To study the presidency is to study human nature and personality, constitution and institution, strategy and contingency. This course will examine the problems
and paradoxes that attend the exercise of the most powerful political office in the world's oldest democracy: Can an executive office be constructed with sufficient
energy to govern and also be democratically accountable? How much do we attribute the shaping of politics to the agency of the individual in the office and to
what extent are politics the result of structural, cultural, and institutional factors? Are the politics of the presidency different in foreign and domestic policy? How
are national security concerns balanced with domestic priorities such as the protection of civil liberties? How is the office and purpose of the presidency affected
by an economic order predicated on private capital? Exploration of these questions will lead us to examine topics such as presidential selection, the bases of
presidential power, character and leadership issues, congressional-executive relations, the media, and emergency powers. Attention will focus largely on the
modern presidency, though older historical examples will also be used to help us gain perspective on these problems.

PSCI 223(F) International Law
International law embodies the rules that govern the society of states. It spells out who can be a state and how to become one, what states can do, what they cannot
do, and who can punish transgressions; it also determines the status of other actors, like international organizations, heads of state, refugees, transnational religious
institutions and multinational corporations. International law is like domestic law, with one difference: the same group that makes the law enforces it. In other
respects it is the same: it protects the status quo, including the distribution of power among its members; it spells out legitimate and illegitimate ways of resolving
conflicts of interest; it is biased toward the powerful; it tells its members how to act to coordinate their interests and minimize direct conflict; some of it is laugh-
able and purely aspirational, some of it necessary for survival. And like domestic law, it is enforced only some of the time, and then against the weak more than the
strong. Yet law is still where we look first for justice. This course will examine the historical bases of contemporary international law, its development since World
War II in the context of the Holocaust and decolonization, and current dilemmas in its practice. Students will study primary materials (treaties and cases). This is
not a law-school class but an academic course; that is, you learn the law, but do so as a way to learn "about" the law.

What makes political thought "American"? Is there something distinct about the American political imagination that shapes how we think about liberty, equality,
and government? And who exactly is the "we"? This course examines these questions and others by exploring the evolving relationship between conceptions of
"the frontier" and the idea of representation throughout American history. We shall see that debates over how to represent the community lead almost inescapably
to the question of the proper boundary of the community - of who gets included or excluded from membership in the polity. We will explore the Founding period
in detail, and then move on to examine several expansions of the public sphere in the 19th and 20th centuries, including those related to race, gender, class, and
nationality. How do these openings in the political realm reflect differing notions of freedom, justice, and property? In conclusion we will ask how the meaning of
"America" may be affected by recent debates over immigration and "la frontera" to the south.

thinkers as Epictetus and Augustine, and, from a political and theoretical point of view, selections from the Hebrew Bible and New Testament. Among the
questions that we will address: What is justice? How can it be known and pursued? How is political power generated and exercised? What are the social and
ethical prerequisites--and consequences--of democracy? Must the freedom or fulfillment of some people require the subordination of others? Does freedom
require leading (or avoiding) a political life? What distinguishes that kind of life from others? What does it mean to be "philosophical" or to think "theoretically"
about politics? Although we will attempt to engage the readings on their own terms, we will also ask how the vast differences between the ancient world and our
own undercut or enhance the texts' ability to illuminate the dilemmas of political life for us.

stonecraft (1759-1797), John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), and Karl Marx (1818-1883). We will look at the contexts in which these thinkers wrote, and the political
problems and events to which their writings were (in part) a response. Some of the questions posed by these early thinkers are however still enormously important
to politics today, and we will also read these texts with these questions in mind: Are politicians obligated to act honorably and morally, or only to secure the peace
and keep office? What is human nature really like, outside of political society? Why should people obey political authority anyway? Who gets to be a citizen, and
why? What do citizens owe one another? Should democratic states tolerate groups with highly unorthodox beliefs and practices, and if so, why? How did social
and political inequality come about? And does justice require an equitable distribution of power, and of economic resources?

PSCI 235(F) Multiculturalism and Political Theory (D)
Liberal democracies today face demands for greater recognition and accommodation by ethnic, racial, religious, sexual, and linguistic minorities. Political theory
has had much to say about these claims in recent years, especially where they intersect with liberal and democratic principles and practices. This course explores
key justice claims made by minority communities in liberal democracies, ranging from demands for greater political representation by particular communities
and recognition for their distinct identities, to calls for special group rights and arrangements, and even to forms of self-government and self-determination. We
will also assess the justifications typically offered by groups to back up their claims--justifications that appeal to the value of culture identity and cultural mem-
bership, the importance of community self-preservation, and the benefits of diversity, amongst other things. Special attention will be paid to areas of tension
between the practices and demands of cultural minorities on the one hand and particular liberal-democratic norms, values, and institutions on the other. In addition
to considering particular theories for cultural group recognition, we will explore arguments against formal multiculturalism, such as those that appeal to moral and
political "cosmopolitanism" and those that call for a politics of social and economic redistribution over a politics of cultural identity. Part of the College's Explor-
ing Diversity Initiative, this course invites students to reflect critically on the ways that diversity matters to social and political life, as well as to learn and theorize
about alternative ways of engaging and recognizing social differences.

honor when he assumed the presidency, but the war lasted for another four years with many additional casualties. This course examines the complex political
processes that led successive American presidents to get involved in a conflict that all of them desperately wanted to avoid. We will examine both the international
and domestic context of the war, as well as pay close attention to both South and North Vietnamese perspectives on the war. In addition, we will examine the

PSCI 247(F) Political Power in Contemporary China
The People's Republic of China presents us with two grand political narratives: socialism and democracy. In the Maoist era, a distinctive understanding of social-
ism, which claimed to be a more genuine democracy, brought hope and, ultimately, tragedy to hundreds of millions of people. In the post-Mao era, Chinese
politics has been driven by the need to redefine socialism in the wake of the world-historic calamities of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and,
more recently, the end of the Cold War. The state cannot simply give up the socialist myth because without it the rationale for Communist Party hegemony
evaporates. But China's rulers cannot avoid political reform, both ideological and institutional, because to do so heightens the legitimacy crisis born of Maoist
failures. Within this context has emerged the contemporary Chinese democracy movement which, in all of its complexity, looks to both socialist discourse and
Western practice to create a new politics that checks tyrannical abuses of state power and engenders a civil society. What is Chinese democracy now? What are its
prospects and what is its relationship to the ideas of socialism?

PSCI 248T The USA in Comparative Perspective (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
This course considers politics and society in the United States comparatively, from a variety of viewpoints and by authors foreign and American, historical and
contemporary. Important topics of comparison include: the colonial experience and independence; race relations and the African diaspora; nationalism and na-
tional identity; war and state-building; American exceptionalism, religion, and foreign policy; the role of political and economic institutions; and the origins and
shape of the welfare state. (As the list suggests, the most common comparisons are with Latin America and Western Europe, but several of our authors look
beyond these regions.) Along the way, we also read short descriptive accounts by foreign observers, from Crvecoeur and Tocqueville to Jos Mart, Max Weber,
and Sayyid Qutb.

PSCI 250(S) Theories of Comparative Politics
This course will deal with the debate between Karl Marx and Max Weber that organizes much of the contemporary study of comparative politics. The course is
divided into four sections. First, it begins with a close reading of Marx and Weber and a comparison of their modes of political analysis. It will engage the debate
between them about the source and nature of power. What is it, and where does it come from? Is it primarily "material" in content or largely "ideal"? What does
each think about the origins of capitalism, and what is at stake theoretically in their respective interpretations? Second, the course will consider how Marx and
Weber have influenced 20th century thinking about the relationship between capitalism and modernity. Is modernity intimately linked with capitalism, as Marx
would argue, or is it separate from it, as Weber would have it? To get at this question, we will read Karl Polanyi and Barrington Moore in this section. Third, the
course will address Marxist and Weberian treatments of states. What are they? Where do states come from? Do they originate in consent? In war? Are they
autonomous from or captured by social forces? In this section, we will read Charles Tilly, Theda Skocpol, Alfred Stephan, and Karl Schmitter. Finally, the course
will consider what Marx and Weber have to say about the nature and origins of collective political identities (national, ethnic, cultural). What are they and where
do they come from? Are they artifacts of the economy, as Marxists suggest, or do they come from states and religions, as Weber has it? To engage these questions,
we will read Samuel Huntington, among others.

PSCI 252 Terrorism in Comparative Perspective (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Many Americans may have learned about terrorism on September 11, 2001, but the phenomenon was common in twentieth century politics and political dis-
course. Terrorism was practiced, defined, and debated over and over before the American government declared war on it. The debates, however, established only
that no single definition of terrorism has been agreed on. We consider rival definitions of terrorism and identify their differences but focus attention on the more
interesting question of what is at stake politically and morally in the rival definitions. The course then looks at three different settings in which terrorism--or
accusations of terrorism--have featured prominently. We begin by looking at the conflict in Northern Ireland, to get a sense of who uses "terrorism" and why, and
what it means to characterize some violence as terrorist (as opposed, say, to "political"). Next, we consider state violence in South Africa during apartheid, to
determine what is at stake in debates about whether state violence may be characterized as terrorist. Finally, we read about al-Qaeda, an organization that, quite
unusually, does not recoil from charges that it uses terrorism. Why has al-Qaeda adopted terrorism, how is its terrorism similar to and different from that of other
organizations, and what is the purpose of terrorism for al-Qaeda? By comparing these three examples, we develop a sense of the value of the category of terrorism
240
and a sharper sense of what is meant when violence is called terrorism.

PSCI 254(S) Democracy in Comparative Perspective
This course deals with what democracy means and how it is achieved. It begins by weighing competing definitions of democracy. Democracy increasingly is
being viewed in procedural terms: democratic societies are societies that make decisions in particular kinds of ways, regardless of the substance of decisions.
While this view has deep roots in democratic theory and practice, it has competed historically with more substantive definitions of democracy, which emphasize
outcomes and, particularly, progress towards equality of outcomes. This course will examine this debate and consider the reasons why procedural definitions
currently are ascendant. Then the course considers what it means to understand democracy to be universally available. What does it mean to ditch the "precondi-
tions" that formerly were considered to be necessary prior to the making of democratic government and to conceive of democracy as a global force? Does that
mean that democracy is available to all societies or does that mean that the expansion of capital globally is being called"democracy?" To get at the stakes in this
question, the course will consider in depth the impact of the"third wave" of democratization on Latin America and Africa. What processes are being designated as
"democratic," why do they coincide with high levels of socio-economic inequality, and what is the impulse behind democratization? Finally, the course will
address the role of identities, especially ethno-cultural ones, in democracies: what weight do identities play in representation and what impact does representation
via identity have on equality in democratic government?

This course provides a broad introduction to the politics of contemporary Africa, emphasizing along the way the diversity of African politics. It seeks to challenge
the widespread image of African politics as universally and inexplicably lawless, violent, and anarchic. This course begins by examining the nature and legacies
of colonial rule and nationalist movements. From there, we consider the African state, highlighting the factors that have made some states weak and others strong.
The course then turns to how ethnicity, class and civil society operate as bases of political mobilization. Finally, the course analyzes the causes, consequences and
limitations of the recent waves of political and economic liberalization across Africa.

Independence across Africa produced an impressive list of first-generation rulers (Nkrumah, Nyerere, Senghor, Mandela, Banda, Houphouet-Boigny, Kaunda,
Kenyatta, Khama, to name a few). These courageous, charismatic and well-educated figures embodied the promise and hope of self-determination. Although
these leaders succeeded in challenging the colonial state and promised to bring freedom and development, within a decade of independence hope had turned to
despair as many of them re-invented themselves as autocrats while others succumbed to coups. Only a few succeeded. What went so terribly wrong? Why did the
promise of freedom turn so quickly into limited participation or outright repression? To answer these questions, this course examines the lives, political ideas and

after the defeat of Nazi Germany? Second, was one side primarily responsible for the length and intensity of the Cold War in Europe? Third, how did the Cold
War in Europe lead to events in other areas of the world, such as Cuba and Vietnam? Finally, could the Cold War have been ended long before the collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1989? Political scientists and historians continue to argue vigorously about the answers to all these questions. We examine both traditional and
revisionist explanations of the Cold War, as well as the new findings that have emerged from the partial opening of Soviet and Eastern European archives. The
final section of the course examines how scholarly interpretations of the Cold War continue to influence how policymakers approach contemporary issues in
American foreign policy.

A decade ago, tourism passed oil to become the world's most valuable export. This arguably frivolous activity accounts for more than 10 percent of global GNP,
and employs an enormous number of people. Tourism accounts for most of the revenue that the poorest countries receive; meanwhile, presidents and prime
ministers of nuclear-capable countries beg on TV for visitors. Where are the politics in this vast, complicated industry and why is no one paying attention? This
class explores types of tourism, asking what happens in a tourist encounter, who benefits, who loses, and what changes. We will examine cases-Antigua vs.
Auschwitz, Angkor Wat vs. Alaska-to help us understand the process from the points of view of the tourists, the toured-upon, and the governments and interna-

distinct but inter-related aspects of international relations in East Asia: Security, economy, and culture by using some core concepts and theoretical arguments
widely accepted in the study of international relations. We will engage some of the central questions and issues in the current debate on East Asia. Do East Asian
countries seek for security and prosperity in a way fundamentally different from the Western system? Is there a single best way to maintain regional order and
cooperation across regions? Will a strong China inevitably claim its traditional place under the Sun? Will Japan continue to live as a nation with enormous
economic power but no military means? What is the choice for South Korea between security alliance with the United States and national reconciliation with the
North? Will North Korea survive? What should be done to dissuade the totalitarian regime in North Korea from acquiring nuclear capabilities and lead it to

century's transatlantic movement to abolish slavery, we will examine international movements and institutions that have affected what human rights mean, to

In the social sciences, clear rules describe how to design and conduct empirical research: how to choose cases to study, how to make a judgment about causation,
how to recognize and assess disconfirming evidence. This course teaches those rules. We discuss how to state a researchable question and how to determine what
counts as an answer to that question; pay close attention to explanation, to falsifiability, and to the validity of evidence; and consider issues of measurement, how
to identify and evaluate alternative explanations for the same event, and how to qualify conclusions. Students learn about and then conduct interviews, surveys,
archival research, case studies and field studies; they collect data, and evaluate those data. The course involves substantial math, but at a level below calculus; it
does not teach math, but does ask students to use the math they know in new ways. The course always first examines the logic underneath the math, requiring
explicit attention to categories before measuring them.

`Ronald Reagan's pronouncement in 1981 that "government is not a solution to our problem, government is the problem" defined American politics for nearly
three decades. Skepticism of government has deep roots and strong resonance throughout American political history, yet in many ways the American state has
grown steadily larger and stronger. This course explores this conundrum by examining the American state, and its growth, in various arenas. We will assess
traditional theories about the weak American state in light of arguments about the state as: regulator of family and "private" life, adjudicator of relations between
racial and ethnic groups, manager of economic inequalities, insurer of security, and arbiter of the acceptable uses of violence and surveillance.

PSCI 309(S) Problems and Progress in American Democracy
"I confess," French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in the introduction to his Democracy in America, "that in America I saw more than America. I sought
the image of democracy itself, with its inclinations, its character, its prejudices, and its passions, in order to learn what we have to fear or hope from its progress."
What would Tocqueville see if he returned to America today, almost 200 years later? What types of institutions, dynamics, and processes animate American
political life in the twenty-first century? With Tocqueville as a guide to thinking about political ethnography, this course investigates six central elements of
political life--religion, education, civic engagement, difference, representation, and crime and punishment--that simultaneously pose problems for and represent
sites of progress in American democracy. For each subject, we will ask several key questions. How has that particular aspect of political life changed in the recent
past? How might it change in the near future? Does it conform to how American politics is designed to work? To how we want American politics to work? Using
a diverse set of readings drawn from empirical political science, contemporary democratic theory, American political thought, historical documents, political
punditry (from the left and the right), and current events, our focus, like Tocqueville before us, is on teasing out both the lived experience--the character and
challenges--of American democracy and examining any disconnect between that experience and the ideals that undergird it. Among the many specific questions
we will consider are the extent to which America is a religious nation, whether recent changes in higher education have affected the health of democratic politics,
the effects of technology on civic engagement, and the place of the jury system in securing democratic justice. Throughout the semester, we will not only ap-
proach these questions from the joint perspectives of theory and practice but also seek to enrich our understanding by exploring American democracy as it
happens all around us with several exercises in the community at large.

PSCI 310(F) Political Psychology (Same as Psychology 345)
Political psychology studies human nature to better understand the possibilities and limitations of politics. For example, many political philosophers begin their
political programs by asserting some foundational claims about "human nature." These claims are then used to support their vision of politics. Claims about
progress often presume that human nature will be improved by implementing a liberal political agenda. For example, the enlightenment held that rationality
would be strengthened by progress, thereby making democracy more viable. Those who defend authoritarian regimes often do so by proclaiming that the general
public is incapable of self-rule and must accept rule by their betters. Many of these arguments turn on how rational people are and on their capacity for and
willingness to pursue justice for all people. We explore what psychology tells us about people as political citizens and as leaders. The course pays special attention
to the powerful, but surprising, roles that emotions play in all aspects of politics. Central to politics is the general issue of judgment, and its more important
variants, moral and political judgment. If we are to trust ourselves to rule ourselves, how well will we secure justice and liberty for one and all among us? Political
psychology is one of the very oldest disciplines (it can be dated at least back to the early classic Greeks, among them Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle). The issue of
citizen competence for self and collective rule, then as now, was at the center of their attention. So, it shall be in this course.

From the Founding to the present, the American political order has undergone incredible, cataclysmic and thoroughgoing transformations, yet has also proven to
be remarkably enduring. How can this be? Where and how has the country's political history been stable? What accounts for the timing of upheavals? Who or
what causes them? What sorts of transformations have been possible? Finally, what are the costs of change (and of continuity)-and who pays them? The goal of
this tutorial is to gain an understanding of the country's continuity, along with the impulses behind its transformative episodes, especially in the state's relation to
society and to the economy. When does the state protect property and liberty? When does it prioritize equality? We look at what led to the civil rights movement,
how women won the right to vote, and why rights-denying and discriminatory legislation and practices persist. We also read about the social and economic
decisions of particular leaders, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, some argue, succeeded in building the modern welfare state at the cost of a vibrant democratic

PSCI 315 Parties in American Politics (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Political parties have played a central role in extending democracy and organizing power in the United States, yet their worth is a continuing subject of debate. In
one ideal formulation, parties not only link citizens to their government, they also provide the coherency and unity needed to govern in a political system in which
power is widely dispersed. But there is also an American tradition of antipathy toward parties. They have been criticized for inflaming divisions among the people
and for grid-locking the government. For others, political parties fail to offer citizens meaningful choices; the Republican and Democratic parties are likened to a
choice between "tweedledee and tweedledum." This course will investigate this debate over parties by examining their nature and role in American political life,
both past and present. How have the parties changed over time? Throughout the course, we will explore such questions as: What constitutes a party? For whom
do they function? Why a two-party system, and what role do third parties play? Is partisanship good or bad for democracy? For governance? And, in the age of
technology and mass communications, are parties still relevant?

Perhaps no single individual has influenced the course of American foreign policy over the last fifty years more than Henry Kissinger. A refugee from Nazi
Germany, Kissinger emerged during the 1950's as one of America's most important scholars of international relations and nuclear strategy. During the 1960's and
1970's, as National Security Advisor and later secretary of State, Kissinger was at the center of some of the important events of the Cold War. This tutorial will
examine Kissinger's thoughts on American policy and international relations as well as record in the Nixon and Ford administrations. In addition, we will also
look at how other scholars have assessed Kissinger's scholarship and his stewardship of American foreign
policy at crucial moments in the history of the Cold War.

This course provides a critical overview of empire and imperialism in international politics from the eighteenth century to the present day. Key questions include:
why do states establish empires? Do empires provide political or economic gains? How are empires governed? What role does technology play in driving and
sustaining empires? How do empires end? What are the legacies of empire? The first section of the course examines these questions by consulting the classic
theoretical works on empire by Smith, Marx, Lenin, Seeley, Mackinder, Hobson, and Schumpeter. The second section explores these theories through a struc-
tured historical comparison of imperial expansion and contraction in North America, Latin America, Asia and Africa. The final section explores the contempo-
rary relevance of the concept of empire for understanding American post-war foreign policy, including issues such as overseas basing, humanitarian intervention,

Two converging realities create a political and intellectual problem: an evolving recognition of the vitality of private sector supported community organization
work; and the challenge that such organizations may have to assume a larger role due to reductions in public agency support and declining participation among the
poor and racial minorities. In the United States these agencies-essentially NGOs-play important roles in communities and movements, often modeling the very
programs adopted by the government. Some, like the Highlander Center, have near-mythical status in our memories about what it means to struggle for social
change; others, including HARYOU, were critical in structuring thought about anti-poverty strategies. In recent years some like Teach for America have plunged
into the thick of the effort to keep public education a viable option. This tutorial examines the role of non-profits and social justice work in the United States

PSCI 332 Rethinking the Political (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
What is politics? The question has been an important part of political theory at least since Socrates and Plato. It has taken on renewed significance in recent years,
as theorists have sought to rethink the political in response to the most disastrous of twentieth century political developments (genocide, totalitarianism, etc.), to
the assorted identity-based struggles that have challenged prevailing political terms and arrangements, and to the transformations wrought by the forces and
processes of "globalization." In this seminar, we will engage some of the major attempts at rethinking produced in the 20th and 21st centuries. Our readings will
be drawn from such thinkers as Arendt, Agamben, Benjamin, Brown, Connolly, Derrida, Fanon, Foucault, Gramsci, Habermas, Mouffe, Rancire, Rawls,
Strauss, Schmitt, and Wolin Throughout the semester, our goal will be to come to terms not only with the theoretical arguments but also the motivating problems:
we will read the texts contextually, perhaps even symptomatically. Among the questions we will ask, then, are why there is such a preoccupation with the meaning
of the political and whether the theorists are evading or repressing the very circumstances that structure political outcomes and possibilities.

PSCI 334 Theorizing Global Justice (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
One of the most important issues in political theory today is the problem of global justice. As the gap between rich and poor nations increases and the changes
associated with globalization render states' borders increasingly ineffectual, moral and political philosophers can arguably no longer confine their theories of
justice to the safe space of single liberal democratic polities, such as the United States. Looming human and environmental crises underscore the need to look
beyond one's borders when thinking about the goals of equality and well-being or flourishing, and the duties we owe to others. This course takes up the main
works in normative theorizing about global justice, and also looks at the possibility of transnational institutions for justice, starting with Immanuel Kant and
moving on to such contemporary philosophers and political theorists as John Rawls, Thomas Pogge, Amartya Sen, Martha Nussbaum, Onora O'Neill, Antonio
Negri, Richard Rorty, Anthony Appiah, Ronald Dworkin, G.A. Cohen, Peter Singer, Iris Young, and Michael Walzer.

PSCI 339(S) Politics and Aesthetics (W)
In recent years, political theorists have grown increasingly preoccupied with questions of what since the Romantic era has been called "aesthetics." In a moment
of global economic crisis, amidst continuing problems of war, violence, poverty, and injustice, this concern may seem puzzling, even fundamentally misplaced.
Yet just as Plato, for instance, famously connected questions of the good and the true to those of the beautiful (so that it is anachronistic to impute to him a
separation between political and aesthetic domains), some notable recent theorists claim that investigating aesthetic matters can enable us to gain a better under-
standing of political perceptions, ideals, aspirations, struggles, and possibilities. Among the main questions we will ask in this seminar is whether or not that claim
is persuasive. Along the way, we will we will pay sustained attention to such matters as the role of emotion, affect, and the senses in political life, the nature of
aesthetic judgment, its relationship to both political judgment and structures of power, and the similarities and differences between making art and acting politi-
cally. We will also, of course, examine what it means to call something "aesthetic," and we will think about the limits of the aesthetic as a category of analysis.
Though we will regularly take up examples drawn from the worlds of art, politics, and the mass media, our central focus will be on the careful reading of philo-
sophical and critical texts, including Kant's Critique of Judgment and writings from among the following authors: Adorno, Arendt, Bal, Benjamin, Bourdieu,
Burke, Cavell, Danto, Deleuze, Dickie, Felski, Freud, Hegel, Heidegger, Hume, Mill, Nietzsche, Ramachandran, Rancire, Schiller.

The futures of Mexico and the United States are now bound up more closely than ever. Yet Mexico enters this future with a very different past, a distinctive
political system, and mixed feelings about the US. This course has four parts that differ both in content and in format. The first is historical and mostly lecture. It
considers several themes, including the slow emergence of a stable national state and the interplay between politics and economic change. In the second section,
enrollment permitting, the class breaks into tutorial groups to consider four general themes that link historical and cultural themes with contemporary problems:
the politics of Mexican national identity; the impact of migration and the rapid development of the northern border region; urbanization; and political corruption.
In the third section of the course, we have standard lecture-and-discussion classes on contemporary economic and political issues. At the end, we turn to a semi-

PSCI 347(F) Enlarging Europe: Political Transformations and Current Challenges
In this course we will analyze and assess the major political, social and economic transformations taking place in Europe. First, European states have intensified
their cooperation and pooled sovereignty within the European Union. How and by what means can states that fought each other during the second world war and
represented two competing alliances during the bipolar world order make common policies in an increasing number of policy areas within the EU? Second, the
older and younger democracies in Europe are facing a multitude of challenges. Even though democracy is widely supported by European citizens, traditional
forms of democratic citizenship such as voting and membership in parties and organizations are in decline in the "west", whereas citizens in Central and Eastern
European states manifest low trust in political institutions and political parties. The party political landscape is transforming. In the 1980s new political cleavages,
such as environmentalism, were added to the traditional left-right dimension. Since the 1990s populist and right-wing radical parties voicing criticism against the
political and economic establishments and representing xenophobic and anti-islamic ideas have gained support. Third, some claim that the European welfare
states based on taxation and redistribution are under threat due to globalization and europeanization. Is the welfare state in terms of publicly provided health
services, education, child and elderly care an asset or a burden in the current economic crisis? Similarities and differences among the European welfare systems
will be analyzed and compared.

Zimbabwe's political and economic institutions have all but collapsed. Almost universally, Zimbabwe's unraveling is attributed to the government's compulsory
acquisition of white-owned farms between 1999 and 2000. This course examines both the politics that produced white-black land disparities in Zimbabwe and
the post-independence politics that sustained the inequalities for close to two decades. The course also considers why the status quo was broken in 1999-2000.
What did Robert Mugabe hope to gain by acquiring and redistributing white-owned farms? Did the policy unwittingly lead to the subsequent collapse of political

What, if any, is the relationship between economic development and the organization of power (regime type)? Does economic development lead to the spread of

PSCI 355T(F) Realism (W)
Realism in politics is both an approach to international relations and a political sensibility. As a sensibility, it values limits, questions good intentions, and worries
about grand ambitions. It takes the basic contours of human behavior as given and beyond the control of actors to alter, perhaps giving rise to a kind of passivity in
response. The realist sensibility tends to doubt the efficacy of human action, to believe that attempts to improve the terms of human interaction not only are
doomed to fail but also are likely to make things worse. Realists are not necessarily conservative--a few are radical--but they have learned much from conserva-
tives. By temperament, they are not confident of the capacities of human agencies.
Realism also is a distinct approach to the conduct and the study of international relations. Realists have basic tenets--states are primary actors and operate to
increase their relative power in a world in which anarchy puts a premium on self-help--that guide their thinking about international relations, but the readings on
realism in international relations will highlight the underlying politics of realists. We will consider the realist emphasis on power, the status of morality, the rela-
tionship between power and morality, what critics of realists have to say about the realist treatment of these issues, and how realism in international relations
connects with realism as a political sensibility. We will read works by Carr, Greene, Kissinger, Lenin, Machiavelli, Mearsheimer, Orwell, and Waltz.

to address this current crisis. But what are those lessons? And are they the right ones to rely upon today?
This course is a comparative study of `great depressions' over the past 80 years with special focus on how, in light of past contractions and crises, we might
understand the current global economic downturn, the political conflicts it has spawned, and the policies designed to counteract it. Empirical interest is centered

PSCI 410(S) Senior Seminar in American Politics
The United States of 2009-2010 is considerably different from the United States of 1787. Over the past two hundred and twenty plus years the population has
grown by many multiples, the character of the society has changed from part slave, agricultural and mercantilist to increasingly democratic, liberal, urban and
246
free-market. Further, the United States of 1787 had recently won its freedom from the major imperial power of the period, England (thereby changing its status
from colony to sovereign nation). Now, the United States is the major imperial power of the world (even if bedeviled by anti-American movements of various
kinds). Beyond these differences are innumerable others--demographic, institutional, technological and political.
The focus of the American Politics senior seminar for this year is whether the Constitutional Framework and the rationales that justified those arrangements
remain well suited to our current circumstances. And, if not, what could or should be done to redress that ill fit. There are two considerations that will broadly
shape our deliberations and discussions this semester. The first consideration will be an analytic one: what claims of justice and freedom are embedded in Ameri-
can political institutions? These claims form the normative standards we can use to judge the success of American democracy, then and now. Which in turn raises
the second question: are these foundational views, as best we can understand them, adequate to our times?

PSCI 420T Senior Seminar in International Relations: Law and Rights in International Politics (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered
2010-2011)
The subject of law and rights in international politics raises fundamental questions about the nature of the international system, about what law means in the
absence of an enforcing sovereign, about whether persons can have rights independent of the government. It also raises dramatic and salient questions about how
these concepts get used to increase or wrest power--how, for example, a claim to human rights might affect a regime, or why admitting a policy of torture seems
difficult when its consequences are so minimal. It has room for philosophy and for politics. We will start examining these questions by drawing on classic interna-
tional relations theory, and then complicate this theory as we move through the semester.

PSCI 420 Senior Seminar in International Relations: Globalization and War (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
This seminar examines whether the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq have fundamentally altered the trends of globalization that unfolded over the previous
few decades. We first read about globalization. We will not read everything there is to read about globalization; nor will we attempt to survey all theoretical
perspectives on globalization. Rather, we engage several different perspectives to familiarize ourselves with the major issues. Students write two 5-page papers on
two of the books we read together. The second part of the course centers on individual student research projects. Each student chooses some facet of the Iraq war
or the war on terrorism and, throughout the semester, combs journalistic and academic sources for information. Each student makes a presentation to the class on
the topic of his or her research and, finally, each writes a 20-page research paper engaging the question of how that particular aspect of the war on terrorism or the
war in Iraq has influenced larger processes of globalization.
Format: seminar. Requirements: seminar participation, two short papers, class presentation, research paper.
Prerequisites: at least two previous classes in international relations, and junior or senior standing. Enrollment limit: 16 (expected: 16). Preference given to senior

PSCI 420/440(F) Senior Seminar in International Relations and Comparative Politics: The War in Iraq
This senior seminar will consider rival explanations for why the United States went to war in Iraq and why the venture has gone wrong. Why did the U.S.
government opt for war in Iraq: was it fear of weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda or the appeal of oil or the pursuit of geopolitical advantage or the
influence of domestic lobbies, moral appeals, or imperialist impulses? And are the problems with the invasion the result of American mismanagement or the
predictable effect of the invasion itself?

PSCI 420(F) Senior Seminar in International Relations: War in the Modern Age
International relations theory holds that war-making and the sovereign state are inextricably linked: war made states, and states make war. Is this still true? This
seminar examines the question of whether war remains the province of the state by inquiring into apparently stable, and apparently altered, aspects of the contem-
porary use of force. What are the causes of contemporary wars? Can wars ever be started justly? Who fights in wars and who suffers? How do wars end? How has
technology changed the face of modern warfare? Is war becoming obsolete? This course will also consider whether classical theories are applicable to "new"
wars such as guerilla wars, insurgencies, civil strife, and ethnic conflict.

The most powerful actors in the international system are liberal ones, and a liberal project around open trade and investment, international organizations and
democratic states dominates the global agenda. This course is an investigation into this liberal international relations project, engaging both theory and practice.
We will discuss signature liberal international relations theorists both classic and current as well as their critics. We will also attend to empirical evaluations of
signature liberal efforts around peace promotion, economic growth and development, and democratic governance as well as discuss the successes and failures of
transnational liberalism as a global social movement.

PSCI 420/440 Senior Seminar in International Relations and Comparative Politics: The Power of the Purse in International Politics (Not
offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
US foreign policy faces money problems. First, it has to grapple with security issues having less to do with defense against powerful enemy states and more with
matters of internal politics in relatively weak states, often nominal allies. Many prominent observers (Thomas Friedman on "petropolitics," for example) have
pointed to the critical role of public finance in determining the evolution and behavior of these states. Second, it faces the erosion of US financial hegemony, as
deficits continue while foreigners already own about half of US Treasury debt (and their central banks hold most of that). These ideas connect to other, more
general ones about the rise of the West, the origins of the nation-state, and the channels of international economic power. In this course we look at historical and
contemporary connections between money and power, especially on the links between the ways states obtain revenue oil rents, taxation, foreign aid, and credit--
and the ways they act and evolve.

PSCI 430(S) Senior Seminar in Political Theory: Heretical Political Theory-Hannah Arendt and C.L.R. James (Same as Africana Studies
430)
In 1963, the German migr political theorist Hannah Arendt published On Revolution, a sustained meditation on the meaning of freedom in the American and
French Revolutions. The Trinidadian thinker C.L.R. James also published in that year the significantly revised version of his classic text on the Haitian Revolu-
tion, The Black Jacobins. Arendt and James are unorthodox anti-Marxist and Marxist theoreticians respectively. Despite addressing many of the same topics such
as political freedom, totalitarianism, domination, race-thinking, Diaspora, exilic intellectuals, Herman Melville, the Council System during the Hungarian Revo-
lution and the legacy of Karl Marx for the human condition, these thinkers have only recently become the focus of close comparative analysis. This seminar will
situate Arendt and James as heretics--those persons existing at the margins of society whose thought seeks to transform the prevailing normative structures of a
society's order of things. We shall spend the first quarter of the seminar investigating the emergence and evolution of the idea of the interrelated notions of heresy,
the heretic, and heretical discourse from the Middle Ages to the late modern world. Authors and figures we will consider include Anthony Bogues, Pierre Bour-
dieu, Indira Gandhi, Joan of Arc, Malcolm Lambert, Patrice Lumumba, R.I. Moore, Walter Rodney, Deborah Root, St. Augustine, Baruch Spinoza, Ida B. Wells-
Barnett, and Sylvia Wynter. A majority of the course will be devoted to an exegesis of select primary texts by Arendt and James. Students also will analyze
secondary interpretations of those works within the context of the recurring trope of the heretic and the perspective of heretical political theory.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class attendance and active participation, weekly reading response papers, an oral class presentation, a 5-page essay, and one 18-
to 20-page final research paper containing an abstract, keywords, text, and endnotes.

PSCI 430 What Should Political Theory Be Now? (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Why be theoretical? Toward what end and with what means? In this course we will consider how--and whether--people can usefully theorize about political life
in this era. In pursuit of these questions, we will examine some exemplary works in recent and contemporary theory. Our discussions will pay attention to the
ways of thinking and writing that these works embody, asking whether these are ways we should pursue ourselves. But this is not a course on "method," and our
readings will enable us to confront some of the most controversial arguments and pressing substantive problems in contemporary political and social thought. We
will take up such topics as democracy and globalization, the sources and workings of political evil, the nature of political power, justice and the distribution of
resources, and problems of race, class, gender, and sexuality in contemporary American life. Readings will be drawn from such authors as Agamben, Arendt,
Butler, Cavell, Cohen, Connolly, Fanon, Foucault, Fraser, Ranciere, Rawls, Rorty, Said, Schmitt, Sen, Shelby, Spivak, Strauss, Virno, Wolin, and Zizek.

PSCI 440 Senior Seminar in Comparative Politics: The State (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Everybody talks about "The State," but what do they mean? What is the state? Where do states get their authority and power? Where do they come from and why
do some states collapse while others survive? Why are some states strong and others weak? And, really, what does it mean to call a state "strong" or "weak"?
Should political science in general and comparative politics in particular even use states as the central unit of analysis? What do political scientists see and,
perhaps more important, what do they miss by this focus on states? This senior seminar examines a variety of definitions and perspectives on the state.

will be submitted for evaluation by a committee made up of the faculty supervisor and two additional readers to be chosen by the department, in consultation with
the supervisor. Thesis writers will not only work with their advisors but will participate in a weekly honors seminar supervised by a faculty member in political
science. The seminar (which is one component of the 493-W31-494 designation and not a separate course) will provide a focused forum for the exchange of ideas
among the honors students, who will regularly circulate sections of their theses-in-progress for peer review and critique. The faculty seminar leader's primary role

SANDSTROM***, N. SANDSTROM**, ZAKI. Assistant Professors: CROSBY, GREER, HANE**, KORNELL. Senior Lecturer: ENGEL.
MAJOR
For the degree in Psychology, students must complete a minimum of nine courses as outlined below:
1) PSYC 101 Introductory Psychology
2) PSYC 201 Experimentation and Statistics
3) Three 200-level courses, with at least one from each of the following groups.
Group A COGS/PHIL/PSYC 222 Minds, Brains, and Intelligent Behavior: An Introduction to Cognitive Science
NSCI 201/BIOL 212/Psychology 212 Neuroscience
PSYC 221 Cognitive Psychology
Group B PSYC 232 Developmental Psychology
PSYC 242 Social Psychology
PSYC 252 Psychological Disorders
PSYC 272 Psychology of Education
Either PSYC 221 or 222, but not both, can count towards the three required 200-level courses.
4) Three 300-level courses from at least two of the areas listed below:
Area 1: Behavioral Neuroscience (courses with middle digit 1)
Area 2: Cognitive Psychology (courses with middle digit 2)
Area 3: Developmental Psychology (courses with middle digit 3)
Area 4: Social Psychology (courses with middle digit 4)
Area 5: Clinical Psychology (courses with middle digit 5)
Area 6: Other/Interdisciplinary Psychology (courses with middle digit 6)
Area 7: Educational Psychology (courses with middle digit 7)
At least one of these courses must be from among those carrying the format designation Empirical Lab Course.
5) PSYC 401 Perspectives on Psychological Issues
Students who place out of Psychology 101 are still required to take nine courses to complete the major.
The department recommends that students take Psychology 201 in their sophomore year. The department requires that 201 be completed by the end of the
junior year.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN PSYCHOLOGY
Students who are candidates for honors need take only two 300-level courses from two different areas, but they must enroll in Psychology 493-W31-494 and
write a thesis based on original empirical work. Presentation of a thesis, however, should not be interpreted as a guarantee of a degree with honors. Guidelines for
pursuing the degree with honors are available from the department.
STUDY ABROAD
With some advance planning, studying abroad (especially for one semester) can easily be worked into the psychology major. To facilitate this, we recommend
that students:
1) meet with the Department Chair as soon as they decide that they are interested in studying abroad
2) take Psychology 201 (Experimentation and Statistics) in the sophomore year
3) think ahead to the 300-level courses they are interested in taking so that they can fulfill the 200-level prerequisites before they go away or, if possible,
while they are away. In our experience, study abroad programs in the following places are most likely to offer psychology courses: England, Ireland,
Scotland, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Scandinavia. Students should procure the descriptions of the psychology courses they are consid-
ering taking and bring them to their meeting with the Chair.
There are some costs to studying away, particularly for the year. This limits students' opportunities to choose the particular 300-level courses they would like to
take and they must sometimes settle for those that are open, those which happen to be offered, or those for which they have the prerequisites, once they return in
their senior year. Many students who are keen on psychology begin doing research with professors during their junior year, and for some this leads to an honors
thesis in the senior year, summer research, etc. If you are going away for the entire year and do not make such connections with a professor ahead of time (i.e.,
before you go), you may lose out on some of these opportunities to deepen your involvement in the major on campus. On the other hand, studying abroad can be
an invaluable learning experience, so you need to think carefully, in consultation with your advisor and/or the Department Chair, about the costs and benefits of it.
Very occasionally, a student who just begins taking psychology courses late in the sophomore year and wishes to go abroad for the year finds that he/she is not
able to do both, or is restricted in the choice of study-abroad programs.

PSYC 272(S) Psychology of Education
This course introduces students to a broad range of theories and research on education. What models of teaching work best, and for what purposes? How do we
measure the success of various education practices? What is the best way to describe the psychology processes by which children gain information and expertise?
What accounts for individual differences in learning, and how do teachers (and schools) address these individual needs? How do social and economic factors
shape teaching practices and the educational experiences of individual students? The course will draw from a wide range of literature (research, theory, and first
hand accounts) to consider key questions in the psychology of education. Upon completion of the course, students should be familiar with central issues in
pre-college education and know how educational research and the practice of teaching affect one another.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: two short papers and a final project.

PSYC 315(S) Hormones and Behavior (Same as Neuroscience 315)
In all animals, hormones are essential for the coordination of basic functions such as development and reproduction. This course studies the dynamic relationship
between hormones and behavior. We will review the mechanisms by which hormones act in the nervous system. We will also investigate the complex interactions
between hormones and behavior. Specific topics to be examined include: sexual differentiation; reproductive and parental behaviors; stress; aggression; and
learning and memory. Students will critically review data from both human and animal studies. All students will design and conduct an empirical research project.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: presentations and participation in discussions, midterm and final exams, written and oral presentation of the re-
search project.

Diagnosing and treating neurological diseases is the final frontier of medicine. Recent advances in neuroscience have had a profound impact on the understanding
of diseases that affect cognition, behavior, and emotion. This course provides an in-depth analysis of the relationship between brain dysfunction and disease state.
We will focus on neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. We will consider diagnosis of dis-
ease, treatment strategies, as well as social and ethical issues. The course provides students with the opportunity to present material based upon: (1) review of
published literature, (2) analysis of case histories, and (3) observations of diagnosis and treatment of patients both live and on videotape. All students will design

PSYC 317T Nature via Nurture: Explorations in Developmental Psychobiology (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Do your genes determine who you are? This course examines the relative contributions of nature (genetics) and nurture (the environment) to the development of
behaviors such as eating, stress response, learning, play, aggression, parenting, alcoholism, drug addiction, schizophrenia and depression. Modern neuroscience
techniques, such as brain imaging, "knock-out" mice, and quantitative trait loci mapping, report extraordinary new relationships between genes and behavior. In
contrast to these findings are equally innovative studies on the critical effects of the pre- and postnatal environment and the social milieu which support environ-
mental causation of behavior. This tutorial will evaluate theoretical and methodological issues in the scientific literature to arrive at a synthetic understanding of
the epigenetics of behavior. Each tutorial pair will design and conduct an empirical project that will explore their own experimental question about the interaction
of genes and environment.
Format: tutorial and empirical lab course. Requirements: students will meet in pairs with the instructor for an hour each week. Each week, students will either
present an oral argument of a 5-page position paper or respond to their partners' paper. Empirical projects will be presented in a poster session at the final meeting.
Prerequisites: Psychology 212 or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference to Neuroscience concentrators and Psychology

PSYC 318(S) Image, Imaging and Imagining: The Brain and Visual Arts (Same as INTR 223 and Neuroscience 318)
This course will study the intersections of neuroscience and art. The brain interprets the visual world and generates cognitive and emotional responses to what the
eyes see. It is also responsible for creating mental images and then directing the artist's motor output. We will first examine the neural mechanisms of how we
perceive what we see. We will investigate how visual artists have used or challenged perceptual cues in their work. Understanding how the brain perceives faces
will be used to analyze portraiture. We will consider the influence of neurological and psychological disorders of artists on their work. We will examine neuroi-
maging studies questioning whether the brains of visual artists are specialized differently from non-artists. Finally, we will explore how contemporary artists are
using brain images in their artwork, and how "outsider" artists have portrayed brain syndromes and mental states. Students will design and conduct a research
project in visual neuroscience. The class will include field trips to museums and galleries, and participation in programming centered on a WCMA exhibit on this
topic. Students will have an opportunity to create their own artwork in response to these topics, culminating in a class exhibit.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Evaluation will be based on a midterm, several presentations, and a final project.

PSYC 322 Concepts: Mind, Brain, and Culture (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Every time we see something as a kind of thing, every time that we decide that an object is a cup rather than a glass, when we recognize a picture of a familiar face
as a picture of ourselves, or even when we understand speech, we are employing categories. Most categorization decisions are automatic and unconscious, and
therefore have the illusion of simplicity. The complexity of these decisions, however, becomes apparent when we attempt to build machines to do what humans
perform so effortlessly. What are the systems in place that allow us this extraordinary ability to segment the world? Are they universal? How does conceptual
knowledge differ across cultural groups? How do concepts affect our perception? How do the categories of experts differ from the categories of novices? Do
children have the same kind of conceptual knowledge as adults? How are categories represented in the brain? In this course, we explore various empirical find-
ings from cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and anthropology that address these questions.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: short papers, class presentation, and research paper.

PSYC 324T(S) Great Debates in Cognition
The field of cognition is filled with controversies about how the mind really works. For example, is there sufficient evidence for a system in vision that can
become aware of things without actually "seeing" them? Is it necessary to assume that babies come into the world armed with innate linguistic knowledge? Are
humans inherently rational? Can we make inference about the mind using neuroimaging? These debates, and others that we will consider, help fuel scientific
discovery in cognition in interesting ways. In this class, we will consider some of these contemporary debates, weigh evidence on both sides, and discuss the
implications for what we know about the mind.

One aspect of "being human" is that we often make choices that we know are bad for us. In this course we survey theoretical and experimental approaches to
understanding our strengths and weaknesses as decision makers. Topics include normative decision theories, biases in probability judgments, "fast and frugal"
heuristics, impulsiveness and self-control, addictions and bad habits, gambling, and moral decision making.
Format: seminar, with scheduled lab. Requirements: lab attendance, an empirical research project, a written report of the research project, short essays, and class
participation.
Prerequisites: Psychology 221 or 222 or permission of instructor. Permission is typically given to students who have successfully completed Economics 110.
Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Preference given to senior Psychology majors who need the course to fulfill the major. Satisfies one semester of the Division
II requirement.

PSYC 327(F) Optimizing Learning and Memory
What strategies and practices make human learning and memory efficient and effective? This course will cover basic research on learning and memory, and there
will also be an emphasis on practical aspects of memory, as they relate, for example, to witness testimony, sports, and, particularly, education and self-regulated
study. In addition to examining "what works," there will be a second major topic: What do people think works? Memory is complex and often unintuitive, and we
will examine people's misconceptions with respect to, for example, what, when, and how to study. Consistent with what is known about learning and memory,
students will be expected and encouraged to be active participants in, and observers of, their own learning.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: seminar and lab attendance, an original empirical research project (conducted in small groups), a written report of
the research project (written individually), shorter written assignments, an in-class presentation of the research project, quizzes, and class participation.
Prerequisites: Psychology 201 and Psychology 221 or 222, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12). Preference given to Psychology
majors.

PSYC 331T Risk and Resilience in Early Development (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Children are often viewed as vulnerable members of our society, worthy of great care and protection. Paradoxically, equally commonplace is the perception that
children are hearty and resilient individuals who more readily adapt to change than adults. This contradiction is most evident during early development, when the
remarkable plasticity of the rapidly developing brain offers infants and young children an exquisite sensitivity to contextual forces, both positive and negative.
This tutorial explores the risk and protective factors, both within and outside of the young child, that give rise to continuity and change in early development and
focuses on the challenges of translating risk and resilience research into programs that optimize development. Evidence drawn from theories of early experience
and developmental psychopathology will frame our review of the literature on prenatal risk factors, including teratogens and maternal stress; genetic influences,
including gene-by-environment interactions; infant risk factors, including medical fragility and temperament; caregiving risk factors, including maternal and
paternal factors and childcare settings; socioeconomic risk factors, including poverty; and child abuse and neglect. Tutorial assignments will focus heavily on
critical evaluation of the quality of the research and to the translation of the research to applied programs.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet in pairs with the instructor for one hour each week. Each week, students will either compose a position paper
based on the week's readings, or respond to the position paper of their partner.
Prerequisites: Psychology 201 and Psychology 232 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to Psychology majors.

PSYC 332(S) Cognitive Development
In this course we consider how mental abilities, such as language, memory, thinking and imagination develop during the childhood years. We begin by asking
how infants, who do not have language, make sense of their world and how language, once acquired, changes the way children understand their world. We study
how children remember events, both every day and traumatic, and how memory relates to narratives about the self. We examine the development of thinking,
reasoning, and imagination (e.g. pretend play, imaginary companions) and their intersection with related topics, such as children's ability to distinguish between
fantasy and reality. Throughout these discussions, we consider the impact of biology (e.g. changes in the brain) and culture on cognition, as well as the similarities
and differences in the cognitive abilities of normally-developing children and children with developmental problems (e.g., autism). All students will design and
conduct an empirical research project.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: hour exam, thought papers, and a written/oral report of final research project.
Prerequisites: Psychology 201 and Psychology 232 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 14). Preference to Psychology majors.

PSYC 334T(F) Magic, Superstition, and Belief (W)
In the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama played a ritual game of basketball on each election day while John McCain kept a lucky feather in his pocket
throughout the election season. These are but two striking examples of the millions of people who regularly engage in ritualistic or superstitious behavior. But
why? How did the mind evolve to support both logical reasoning and magical thinking? In this tutorial, we explore that question by examining how beliefs,
emotions, and imagination have interlocked in the course of human development. We will discuss and debate how the capacity to imagine facilitates problem
solving, why magical thinking continues in to adulthood, and how our beliefs in both natural and supernatural phenomena are related to the evolutionary forces
that shaped the human mind.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: Students will meet in pairs with the instructor for one hour each week and be fully prepared to discuss the material. Each week,
one member of each pair will either write a 6- to 8-page paper (five papers in total), or respond to the partner's paper. Emphasis will be placed on constructing
critical written and oral arguments.
Prerequisites: Psychology 221 or 232 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected: 10). Preference given to Psychology majors.

PSYC 336(F) Adolescence (W)
Why do we define adolescence as a distinct stage of development? What are its perils and accomplishments? What internal and external forces make adolescence
such a volatile and formative stage of life? The course considers a range of empirical and theoretical material, as well as fiction and film, in order to identify and
understand the behavior and experience of adolescents. Topics include: identity, sexuality, romantic love, intellectual growth, family relationships, psychological
problems, education, and variation between cultures.
Format: seminar. There will be a midterm paper and a group project that will involve several pieces of writing.

PSYC 341(F) Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Discrimination (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 339) (D) (W)
This course will examine social psychological theories and research that are relevant to the understanding of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. We will
take a variety of social psychological perspectives, emphasizing sociocultural, cognitive, personality, or motivational explanations. We will examine the impact
that stereotypes and prejudice have on people's perceptions of and behaviors toward particular groups or group members and will explore a variety of factors that
tend to exacerbate or weaken this impact. We also will consider some of the sources of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination and some of the processes
through which they are maintained, strengthened, or revised. In addition, we will examine some of the effects that stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination can
have on members of stereotyped groups, as well as some implications of the social psychological research findings for issues such as education and business and
government policies. A major component of this course will be the examination of classic and ongoing empirical research.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: weekly brief papers, oral reports, two longer papers.
Prerequisites: Psychology 201 and 242. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference given to senior, then junior Psychology majors.

PSYC 343 The Self (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This course considers "the self" from a social-psychological perspective. We read and evaluate current and classic research to better understand how beliefs and
concerns about the self influence emotion, judgment, and behavior. In particular, we consider the causes and consequences of individuals' tendency to be "ego-
centric" (i.e., self-centered). All students will design and conduct an empirical research project.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: short daily thought papers, formal paper proposal, and a written/oral report of research.

PSYC 344 Advanced Research in Social Psychology (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This course will focus on the process of doing original, empirical social psychological research on specific topics in the field. We will concentrate on two content
areas of research: (1) stereotypes and prejudice, particularly as they touch on issues concerning the academic achievement of women and people of color, and on
the role of self-esteem in stereotyping and prejudice, and (2) interpersonal suspicion, including an examination of factors that might reduce suspicion in interracial
or cross-cultural dyads or groups. Students will research and critically analyze and integrate the relevant literatures concerning these topics, and will design and
conduct original research to test empirically several hypotheses that emerge from these literatures. We will examine a variety of types of research design and
statistical techniques.
Format: Empirical Lab Course. Requirements: a series of papers, written and oral reports of research.
Prerequisites: Psychology 201 and Psychology 242. Enrollment limit: 19. Preference given to Psychology majors.

(See under PSCI 310 for full description.) MARCUS
PSYC 346T(F) Social Psychology and the Environment (Same as Environmental Studies 346) (W)
This is a course in applied social psychology. The purpose of the course is to explore issues related to the environment and environmentalism from a social
psychological perspective. At the core of the course is an attempt to understand why people sometimes engage in environmentally destructive behaviors despite
holding pro-environmental attitudes. We will also examine ways in which research and theory in social psychology may contribute insights to understanding (and
encouraging) environmentally responsible action. Because human behavior plays such an important role in environmental problems, a consideration of human
psychology is therefore an important part of the solution.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: students will meet in pairs with the instructor for one hour per week. Each week, one member of each pair will either write a 6- to
8-page paper (five papers in total), or respond to his or her partner's paper. Emphasis will be placed on constructing critical written and oral arguments that are
informed by theory and empirical data.

PSYC 355 Psychotherapy: Theory and Research (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
Psychotherapy is a young, barely 75-year old psychological endeavor which attempts to promote change and healing through social interaction. Does talking with
a psychotherapist really help people to change--emotionally, cognitively, and/or behaviorally--and how exactly does it help people achieve relief from psycho-
logical disorders and problems? In this course, we will study some of the key approaches to psychotherapy by examining the theories and scientific research that
surround them, and considering theory and research in juxtaposition. This will be accomplished by a close reading and critical analysis of primary source theoreti-
cal papers, videotapes and transcripts of therapy sessions, case studies, and contemporary empirical research studies on psychotherapy outcomes and change
processes. Students will learn how to evaluate the efficacy claims of both standard and new therapies and how to evaluate claims about the mechanisms by which
those therapies work. Current controversies in psychotherapy and psychotherapy research will be used to address these goals.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, four 5-page position papers and two oral class presentations based on these, final term paper in the form
of a grant proposal outlining an important question for psychotherapy research, reviewing the extant literature, and proposing a study to address these questions.
Prerequisites: Psychology 201 and Psychology 252. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19). Preference to Psychology majors.

PSYC 361(F) Psychology of Nonviolence
Nonviolence refers to choice behavior in interpersonal interactions in which physical and psychological injury to others is rejected as an option. In this course we
will study theories of nonviolence, and evaluate the empirical support for their central empirical claims of psychological benefits to the practitioner, attitude
change in the adversary, and positive exemplary effects on social interaction. Topics include anger and self-control, aggression, evil, conflict resolution, empathy,
and forgiveness.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: class attendance and participation, discussion leadership, weekly response papers, short essays, and a final paper.
Prerequisites: any 200-level course in Psychology or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 10). Preference given to Psychology majors.

PSYC 372 Advanced Seminar in Teaching and Learning (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
This advanced seminar will give students an opportunity to connect theory to practice. Each student will have a teaching placement in a local school, and partici-
pate in both peer and individual supervision. In addition, we will read a range of texts that examine different approaches to teaching, as well as theory and research
on the process of education. What is the best way to teach? How do various theories of children and pedagogy translate into everyday practices with students?
Students will be encouraged to reflect and modify their own teaching practices as a result of what we read as well as their supervision. Questions we will discuss
include: What is the relationship between educational goals and curriculum development? What is the relation between substance (knowledge, skills, content)
and the interpersonal dynamic inherent in a classroom setting? How do we assess teaching practices, and the students' learning? What does it take to be an
educated person?
Format: seminar. Requirements: This course involves a field placement, weekly readings, as well as seminar discussion, supervision, one essay and one final
paper.
Prerequisites: Psychology 232 or Psychology 272 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 15). Preference given to Psychology majors and

Public health seeks to understand, and also to protect and improve, health at the level of a community or population. Communities make decisions and allocate
resources that, intentionally or not, fundamentally shape human life. For example, great reductions in sickness and early death have come from social interven-
tions with relatively low financial cost, such as physically separating drinking water from sewage, or distributing aspirin, condoms, mosquito nets, vaccines or
soap, or sharing new ideas about life's possibilities. The way a society is organized affects the way that social and scientific knowledge is distributed within it;
access to that knowledge shapes health at the individual level. At its heart, the study of public health focuses on questions about relationships between science and
society, and between reality and possibility: what effective public health policy is and how we can measure its effectiveness; what the relationship is, and ought to
be, between research and policy; how we reconcile important moral and economic claims, or balance other values that compete with maximizing health; what
counts as disease, over time and among cultures; how we think about cause and responsibility; what constitutes a healthy environment; how our fundamental
beliefs determine our approaches to health decisions; and how such decisions ought to be made.
Public health draws on theory and applied research in the social sciences, natural sciences and humanities. Specialized subjects within public health include
epidemiology, population history, environmental health, disease prevention, aging, biostatistics, reproductive and family health, health policy, health education,
and the politics of health-related research. A good foundation in the study of public health would include at least one course devoted to the field as a whole and one
course in statistics, supplemented by courses that provide grounding in demographic history and processes, decision-making, science and health, and humanistic
and ethical dimensions of the field. It also would include field experience. The advisory committee on public health suggests that the following categories of

MAJOR
The major in Religion is designed to perform two related functions: to expose the student to the methods and issues involved in the study of religion as a
universal phenomenon of psychological, sociological, and cultural/historical dimensions; and to confront students with the beliefs, practices, and values of specif-
ic religions through a study of particular religious traditions. It is a program that affords each student an opportunity to fashion his/her own sequence of study
within a prescribed basic pattern constructed to ensure both coherence and variety. It consists of at least nine semester courses as follows:
Required sequence courses
Religion 101 Introduction to Religion
Two seminars, one that explores a central topic of contemporary critical inquiry in the study of religion (courses numbered 270-299) and one that explores a
body of theory in the study of religion (courses numbered 301-309) Note: WGST 402 will count as a 300-level seminar for the Religion major in
2009-2010.
Religion 401 Issues in the Study of Religion
Elective courses
Five additional courses in Religion are to be selected in such a way that at least one course is taken in both the Western and non-Western traditions. Students
will construct their sequence in consultation with departmental advisors and subject to their approval. In order to achieve a deep coverage of a particular religious
tradition or set of related problems in the study of religion, students are urged to select three electives that together have some kind of coherence, be it cultural,
historical, or topical. Related courses from other departments or programs may be included among the three courses, and the point of coherence can be the subject
of research papers in the senior seminar.
Students are advised to elect additional courses in related fields (e.g., psychology, sociology, anthropology, art, history, philosophy) in order to gain a clearer
understanding of the social and cultural contexts in which religions appear.
For those who wish to go beyond the formally-listed courses into a more intensive study of a particular religious tradition, methodological trend, or religious
phenomenon (e.g., ritual, symbol-formation, mysticism, theology, etc.), there is the opportunity to undertake independent study or, with the approval of the de-
partment, to pursue a thesis project.
The value of the major in Religion derives from its fostering of a critical appreciation of the complex role religion plays in every society, even those that
consider themselves non-religious. The major makes one sensitive to the role religion plays in shaping the terms of cultural discourse, of social attitudes and
behavior, and of moral reflection. But it also discloses the ways in which religion and its social effects represent the experience of individual persons and commu-
nities. In doing these things, the major further provides one with interdisciplinary analytical tools and cross-cultural experience and opens up new avenues for
dealing with both the history of a society and culture and the relationships between different societies and cultures. What one learns as a Religion major is there-
fore remarkably applicable to a wide range of other fields of study or professions.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RELIGION
The degree with honors in Religion requires the above-mentioned nine courses and the preparation of a thesis of 75+ pages with a grade of B+ or better. A
thesis may combine revised work done in other courses with new material prepared while enrolled either in Religion 493-W31 or Religion W31-494. Up to
two-thirds of the work in the thesis may be such revised work, but at least one-third must represent new work. The thesis must constitute a coherent whole either
by its organizing theme or by a focus on a particular religious tradition. Candidates will also be expected to present the results of their thesis orally in a public
presentation. Students who wish to be candidates for honors in Religion will submit proposals and at least one paper that may be included in the thesis to the
department in the spring of their junior year. Students must normally have at least a 3.5 GPA in Religion to be considered for the honors program.
The chair will serve as advisor to non-majors.
STUDY ABROAD
The Williams College Religion Department encourages potential majors to study abroad in order to enhance their education and gain international perspec-
tives on religious studies. There are many excellent study abroad opportunities offering students a variety of possible experiences: among them cultural immer-
sion, field work, intensive language learning, independent study, participation in another educational system. Many of our majors study in the Williams College
Oxford Program, but our majors also regularly pursue a semester or year-long study in other programs.
REL 101(F,S) Introduction to Religion
As an examination of the structure and dynamics of certain aspects of religious thought, action, and sensibility--employing psychological, sociological, anthro-
pological, and philosophical modes of inquiry--the course offers a general exposure to basic methodological issues in the study of religion, and includes consid-
eration of several cross-cultural types of religious expression in non-literate and literate societies.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: a midterm paper and a final exam.

The Hebrew Bible is perhaps the single most influential work in the history of Western philosophy, literature, and art. But the overwhelming presence of the text in
nearly every aspect of modern culture often obscures the sheer brilliance of its narrative technique as well as the complex interplay between law, history, prophe-
cy, and poetry. This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the literary, historical, and theological aspects of the Hebrew Bible with an eye towards devel-
oping a sophisticated understanding of the text in its ancient context. Through the close reading of substantial portions of the Hebrew Scripture in translation and
the application of various modern critical approaches to culture and literature, students will explore fundamental questions about the social, ritual, and philosophi-
cal history of ancient Israel, as well as the fundamental power of storytelling that has resonated across two millennia.
Format: lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be based on class participation, short written assignments, and two to three longer papers.

REL 203 Judaism: Innovation and Tradition (Same as Jewish Studies 101) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (D)
What is the relationship between modern notions of Jewish identity, thought and practice and the Hebrew Bible? How does the modern Reform movement link
itself to the laws of the rabbinic sages? Are there consistent values and ideals that mark Jewish moral thought throughout its history? What elements of the Jewish
tradition have enabled its elasticity and historic persistence? By providing an introduction to the traditions of Jewish thought and practice through the ages, this
course will take up these questions. Though the course's method of progression will be primarily chronological, commencing with myths of Israel's beginnings
and culminating with contemporary debates over Jewish identity, we will additionally emphasize the strong ties between methods of Jewish thought and practices
and the surrounding cultural environments in which they developed. We will approach the tradition not only with historical concerns, but with literary and philo-
sophical aims as well. We will analyze the interpretive strategies, theological presuppositions, and political aims that accompany the tradition both in its continui-
ties and its ruptures. Finally, we will consider the extent to which we can speak of Judaism under the category of religion, considering as well the other categories
that have been proposed for Judaism, Jews and Jewishness, such as nation, people, race and ethnicity, and the motivations behind such designations. Texts will
include the Hebrew Bible, Holz (ed), Back to the Sources; Halbertal, People of the Book; Mendelssohn, Jerusalem; Hertzberg (ed), The Zionist Idea; Levi, Surviv-
al in Auschwitz as well as excerpts and articles available in a course packet.

REL 204 Endtimes: Messianism in Modernity (Same as Jewish Studies 204 and Philosophy 204) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
The sociologist Zygmunt Bauman has described modernity as the period of the world's disenchantment, when God absconded and religion was either rational-
ized or reduced to the category of superstition. Ironically, this very disenchantment might help to explain the persistence of the concept of the messianic in even
the most secular branches of modern European thought. One of Judaism's most powerful and elastic concepts, the notion of the messiah saw a variety of radically
different interpretations between the 17th and 20th centuries. This course will consider the range of modern interpretations of the messiah, taking as its concrete
256
starting point the Sabbatian Heresy of the 17th century and concluding with Derrida's philosophical development of the concept of the messianic as pure interrup-
tion. The course's aim is to use messianism as a focal point around which to consider the dynamic relationship between philosophy and Judaism in modernity.
This course will expose the mutual influences of these two forces, illustrating both how Enlightenment conceptions of progress helped to create the notion of
"messianism" understood as an abstract idea, and how the modern/post-modern philosophical conception of the "messianic" as a force that interrupts time is
dependent upon historical studies of the messianic dimension of traditional Judaism. The readings for each class will not generally exceed 40 pages but will
require close attention. Authors to be read include GWF Hegel, Immanuel Kant, Hermann Cohen, Franz Rosenzweig, Gershom Scholem, Walter Benjamin, and
Jacques Derrida.

REL 205 Ancient Wisdom Literature (Same as Classics 205, Comparative Literature 217 and Jewish Studies 205) (Not offered 2009-2010)
The Biblical books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job are often grouped together under the Hebrew category of hokhmah, `wisdom.' Although these books are
very different in content, they can all be interpreted as meditations on ethical and practical philosophy. In this way, they represent the Hebrew Bible's canonical
embrace of a widespread Near Eastern literary phenomenon. From the instructional literature of Egypt and Mesopotamia to Greek didactic poetry and fables,
ancient Mediterranean cultures offer a wide range of texts that engage the issues of personal behavior, leadership, and justice. Starting with the central wisdom
books of the Hebrew Bible and moving through relevant material from the Apocrypha, New Testament, and the Egyptian and Babylonian traditions, this course
will examine the literature of wisdom throughout the ancient world with an eye toward understanding its various social, political, and philosophical contexts. We
will then consider the Greek wisdom tradition in such texts as Hesiod's Works and Days, Aesop's fables, and fragments from the pre-Socratic philosophers.
Finally, we will explore the influence of these ancient sources on later expressions of wisdom in medieval European literature, as well as more recent examples
such as Benjamin Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanack. All readings are in translation.

REL 206(S) The Book of Job and Joban Literature (Same as Comparative Literature 206 and Jewish Studies 206) (W)
The Book of Job has often been described as the most philosophical book of the Hebrew Bible. The story of one man's struggle to understand the cause of his
suffering and his relationship to God represents the finest flowering of the Near Eastern wisdom literature tradition. Through its exploration of fundamental issues
concerning human suffering, fate and divinity, and the nature of philosophical self-examination, Job has served as a touchstone for the entire history of existential
literature. At the same time, the sheer poetic force of the story has inspired some of the greatest artistic and literary meditations in the Western tradition. This
course will engage in a close reading of the Book of Job in its full cultural, religious, and historical context with special attention to its literary, philosophical, and
psychological dimensions. We will then proceed to investigate key modern works in several genres that involve Joban motifs, themes, and text both explicitly and
implicitly. These texts will include Franz Kafka's The Trial, Archibald MacLeish's J.B., Robert Frost's "Masque of Reason," Carl Jung's Answer to Job, and
William Blake's Illustrations to the Book of Job. All readings are in translation.

How long did Adam and Eve live in the Garden of Eden? What was the mark of Cain? Why did Enoch not die? Who was Noah's wife? How did Giants survive
the Flood? These are only a few of the fascinating questions that ancient readers and interpreters of the Book of Genesis asked and attempted to answer. The first
ten chapters of Genesis present a tantalizingly brief narrative account of the earliest history of humankind. The text moves swiftly from the Creation to the Flood
and its immediate aftermath, but this masterful economy of style leaves many details unexplained. This course will explore the rich and varied literary traditions
associated with the primeval history in the Genesis. Through a close reading of ancient noncanonical sources such as the Book of Enoch, Jubilees, and the Life of
Adam and Eve, as well as Jewish traditions represented in Josephus, Philo, and Rabbinic literature and other accounts presented in early Christian and Gnostic
texts, we will investigate the ways in which the elliptical style of Genesis generated a massive body of ancient folklore, creative exegesis, and explicit literary
re-imagining of the early history of humankind. We will then turn to several continuations of these variant traditions in medieval and early modern literature, with
particular attention to the extensive material on the figures of Cain and Noah. All readings are in translation.

The story of the Jewish man who drove Christ away when he stopped to rest for a moment on his way to the Crucifixion and was doomed to roam the earth until
the Advent is one of the most enduring and productive tales of the Middle Ages. Alternately a shoemaker, carpenter, or even doorkeeper to Pontius Pilate, the
Wandering Jew appears in the folklore, literature, and visual arts of every region and era in European history. This course will explore the rich and varied traditions
associated with this legend from its pre-history in the Hebrew Bible and the Gospels up through its early modern and Romantic heyday. In readings ranging from
medieval chronicles and Reformation pamphlets to works by Chaucer, Schiller, Shelley, and Hans Christian Andersen, we will trace the evolution of this mysteri-
ous wanderer from reviled figure of anti-Jewish polemic, to righteous convert and missionary, to learned sage. Along the way we will also examine the intersec-
tion of the tale with such legendary figures as Cain, Prester John, and the Wild Huntsman. We will then turn to several modern literary reflections and contempo-

Scholars have written much about the history of religion in North America, but the effort has been fraught with many oversights. Recent scholarship has begun to
take account of the fact that most religions in North America either did not emerge from European sources, or have existed long before the arrival of Europeans.
Indeed, many religions have grown out of the American soil during the past several centuries-what some would call the product of religious "cross-fertilization,"
and what others would deem as religious and cultural thievery, i.e. colonialism. This course follows a modified historical trajectory, one that strives to allow the
voices of forgotten "others" to speak, bringing questions of colonialism, identity, and the importance of religious community to the forefront.

This course explores contemporary North America religion from a historical, sociological, and philosophical perspective. We will examine the historical and
contemporary experiences of America's ever-expanding religious diversity, prominently featuring the voices of those traditionally excluded from older, Protes-
tant-informed accounts of American religion. The focus of the course will be the exploration of the ever-expanding variety of new religions in North America,
challenging students to engage the numerous cultural, philosophical, and methodological issues involved with the study of marginal religions. New religions
often highlight cultural anxieties, e.g. loss of identity in contemporary secular societies, responses to new technologies, changing gender roles, globalization, etc.
The study of new religions becomes, then, a closer, reflexive examination of contemporary American culture and its underlying tensions. For example, the
Ralian Movement claims to have cloned the first human. Wicca, on the other hand, offers critiques of environmental depredation and traditional gender roles. In
sum, we will explore the historical roots of the current boom in new religions, detail contemporary issues, and outline the possible forms new and emerging
religions may assume in the coming years. This course will also have a website dedicated to the exploration of new religions, providing links to interesting sites,
basic resources, and student essays/projects.

One of the two most consequential texts in human history, the Qur'an is more conscious of itself as text and the work of interpretation that is part of the life of a
text. Because it is God's most important sign (and also because it is relatively short) millions have memorized it and the art of Qur'anic recitation is one of the
supreme Islamic performing arts. Nevertheless it is primarily as a text that the Qur'an exists in itself and in the minds of Muslims. The text of the Qur'an will thus
be the focus of this course, reading it extensively, intensively and repeatedly throughout the semester. We will attend to the structure and variety of styles and
topics in the text and to the Qur'an's understanding of itself in relation to other forms of literary expression. We will place the form and content in the context of
seventh century c.e. Arab society and attend to the life of the Prophet (PBUH) that provides one crucial framework to the text. Through the lens of tafsir, Qur'anic
commentary, we will also use the text to give an initial survey of some of the main theological, philosophical, mystical and legal developments in the Islamic
tradition. Finally we will explore some of the aspects of the place of the text in the life of Muslims, including the development of calligraphy and recitation.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: three essays (6-8 pages) based on class materials (at least one will have a revision process). Students able to read the
Arabic text may substitute work in a collateral reading group of the Qur'an in Arabic for one of the essays.

The rise of Islam in the seventh-century C.E. is usually seen, by both Muslim and non-Muslim historians, as a total break with the past. This course will challenge
that assumption by placing the rise of Islam in the context of the history of late antiquity (c. 300-700 C.E.). The first half of the course will examine the impact of
Judeo-Christian monotheism in the ancient world, the rise of confessional empires, articulation of new ideas about holiness and its relation to sexuality and the
transformations undergone by Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism. We shall examine the conversation of these traditions with classical pa-
ganism and philosophy, the internal struggle within traditions to define rules of interpretation, the impact of ascetic, iconoclastic and apocalyptic ideas and, finally,
polemics among the traditions. Special attention will be given to borderlands (Armenia, Syria, and Arabia), where the problems of regionalism and religious
diversity were prominent. We will then examine the career of Muhammad (PBUH) in the context of Arabia, the spread of the Islamic empire into Christian and
Iranian worlds, the impact of apocalyptic expectations, the fixation of religious decision-making within the tradition and the question of conversion and religious
diversity within the commonwealth of Islam. The course will end with the flourishing of the Abbasid empire in the ninth century. This course will make use of the

One consequence, intended or not, of recent U.S. actions in the Middle East has been to inflame the Sunni/Shi'ite division and raise fears of Shi'ite ascendancy.
Sectarian conflict is, in fact, the exception rather than the rule in Islamic history because Sunnis and Shi'a have in most places been separate and lived relatively
peacefully together where they intermixed. This is the fourth time in Islamic history when the specter of an ascendant Shi'ism has occupied the Muslim commu-
nity. Shi'ism has always been an alliance of the dispossessed and the intellectuals (assuming the latter are not among the former) and functioned in Islam to
provide a vocabulary of revolution, a highly developed philosophy of religion, and a pietistic fervor in contrast to which Sunnism emerged. This course will
compare the three earlier putative episodes of Shi'ite ascendancy in the eighth, tenth and sixteenth centuries C.E. and set these in conversation with contemporary
developments. We will focus on the role of early Shi'ism as the vocabulary of an alternative vision of the legitimacy of the Islamic state, the ideas of the imamate
and martyrdom, the emergence of Isma'ili and Twelver versions of Shi'ism, the conversion of Safavid Iran to Shi'ism, the Iranian revolution of 1979 and the
scene in the post-Saddam Islamic world.

This seminar examines some of the most important issues, debates, and polemics that occupied Muslim thought since the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1978 (with
special emphasis on the Arab world--the heartland of Islam). The basic theoretical, philosophical and theological principles underlying those controversies will
be carefully explored, discussed and critically brought forward. The influence, use and abuse of traditional Western critiques of modernity and of current post-
modern European attacks on the Enlightenment will be elaborated in the context of their appropriation and exploitation by Islamist theoreticians. These will
include, for example, Foucault's discourse theory, Bachelard's "Epistemological Break", Heidegger's "authenticity", Feyerabend's "Farewell to Reason" and his
"epistemological anarchism", Thomas Kuhn's notion of the "incommensurability of paradigms" and the wholesale assault on the idea of progress. Some of the
debates to be examined are: (a) the real nature of the Islamic Revolution in Iran: (b) the legitimacy and adequacy of such concepts as "Fundamentalism", "Reviv-
alism" and "Islamism" when applied to Islam; (c) The Sunni doctrine of "Hakimiah" (God's Sovereignty) as against the Shi'i doctrine of "Vilayet-e-Faqih" (the
rule of the Jurist): (d) the question of "Orientalism" as triggered by Edward Said; (e) the Salman Rushdie affair and his novel the Satanic Versuses; (f)the concepts
of jihad and jihadism; (g) the future of political Islam after its evolution from fundamentalism to jihadism to spectacular terrorism. The approach will be historical,
comparative and explanatory. The instructor will draw on his experiences as a long-time participant in the discussions, controversies and polemics produced by

philosophical, historical and sociological aspects. On the other hand, this course also seeks to bring out the personal relevance of Buddhist ideas, ensuring that
they are not just considered as objects but also as partners in an ongoing conversation. We start by examining the Theravada tradition of South and South-East
Asia through which we seek to understand some of the basic Buddhist ideas such as no-self, suffering and its origin, and the possibilities for freedom. We then
move to the Indian and Tibetan Mahayana traditions, which are characterized by an increase in the importance of compassion on the basis of the bodhisattva ideal.
In dealing with Buddhism in Tibet, we focus more particularly on the tantric aspects of its tradition. Throughout the course, we are careful to consider Buddhism
not just as a set of thought provoking ideas that can be studied in abstraction from their implementation, but as being based on socially inscribed practices. We
examine a broad range of practices, ranging from so-called popular rituals to the practices of virtuosi. In particular, we examine meditation in the Theravada and
Tibetan Tantric traditions. In this way, we gain a realistic appreciation of the nature, role and difficulties of such a practice, and dispel some of its misunderstand-
ings.

REL 245(S) Tibetan Civilization (D)
Often depicted as Shangrila, a mythical and ideal country, Tibet has had the dubious privilege of being a focus of Western fantasies. One cannot but wonder about
the motives and sources of this mythology. Although this course examines these representations, its main focus is an immersion in the cultural and historical
aspects of Tibetan civilization, which give students the tools with which to understand Tibetan culture from the inside. As such this course is part of the Exploring
Diversity Initiative. We first consider the early history of Tibet, the introduction of Buddhism, the relations between Buddhism and the indigenous religion, and
some of the stages in the development of Tibetan Buddhism. We also examine the historical developments that led to the development of the institutions (such as
the Dalai-Lama) unique to Tibet and some of the aspects of the culture that these institutions helped creating (such as gender roles, family structure and social
stratification). Finally, we consider the more recent tragic events and examine the profound transformations that they have brought. Throughout the course, we
consider the central role of the complex interaction between Buddhism and politics in Tibetan history, both in the pre-modern period and in more recent times,
when the Tibetan people have faced the challenge of how to use their institutions and culture to resist oppression. In this way, we get a footing in the Tibetan
world, and the indispensable assessment of Western representations of Tibet becomes not just an exercise in self-reflection but also a gate to a better understanding
of a remarkable but tragically threatened civilization.

2009-2010) (D)
India is a nation based on difference whose multiple and fragmenting identities are often framed as unified oppositions: Hindu/Muslim, Rich/Poor, Secular/
Religious, Male/Female. This course will deconstruct the media's popular representations of these and other identities in order to complicate the notion of a
diverse Indian nation. It will highlight the range of identities and social practices among India's booming population that have produced critical axes of differenti-
ation such as gender, caste, ethnicity, and religious sect. It begins by considering how the colonial principle of "divide and rule" provides an object lesson in the
ways that difference can be used to sustain both social hierarchy and political rule. It describes how this logic of difference produced the tragedy of Partition and its
legacy for the operation of gender and religion on the subcontinent. We critically examine the class and religious divisions that led to the birth of three nations--
India, Pakistan, and subsequently Bangladesh--and the particular logic of communalism and religious violence in modern India. Throughout, the course attends
to the subjective experience of being Hindu, Muslim, or Sikh, untouchable or upper caste, as well as male or female as a way of understanding the way that
difference shapes individual agency and lives across India. It seeks to empathize or at least understand the perspective of both victims and perpetrators of commu-
nal and gendered forms of violence in India today. This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative by theorizing the ways in which difference has been used
to effect profound historical, social, and individual changes in the Indian subcontinent.

In East Asian cultures, as in the United States, popular conceptions of morality typically take their shape, not from explicit rules, but from moral paragons--styl-
ized figures that are said to embody a distinctive cluster of virtues. For example, American Christians invoke not only Jesus, but also a pantheon of "secular
saints" as diverse as Martin Luther King Jr. and General Patton, George Washington and Cesar Chavez. This course will explore the cultural functions of moral
paragons (and heroes more generally) by introducing students to examples from Chinese and Japanese history, ranging from Confucian articulations of the ideal
scholar-bureaucrat to Buddhist conceptions of the Bodhisattva to Taoist immortals. We will also interpret the top-down creation of new moral paragons by East
Asian states, including the popularization of the samurai in interwar Japan and Mao Zedong's self-presentation as the embodiment of China. National communi-
ties, after all, gain their coherence from the invocation of public lives as well as the repetition of founding myths and collective narratives. Readings will include
primary texts in translation by Chuang-tzu, Confucius, Shantideva and others. This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative by providing students with
tools for cross-cultural analysis of moral paragons, as part of how societies manage difference and articulate hierarchies of privilege and power.

REL 251(S) Zen Buddhism: History and Historiography
Because mystifying references to Zen are strewn throughout American popular culture-from episodes of the Simpsons to names of perfumes and snack foods-
most Americans have an image of Zen Buddhism that is disconnected from anything actually practiced in East Asia. This course offers a corrective to this image
by familiarizing students with both the history of Zen and the historiographical roots of these popular perceptions. This course will examine the origins of Zen
(Ch'an) in China, trace its transmission to Japan, and cover its development in both cultural contexts. It will conclude with an examination of Zen's unique role in
American popular culture. The course will enrich the conventional image of Zen by addressing its involvement with power and governance, gods and demons,
mummies and sacred sites, sex and violence, nationalism and scholarship. Texts will include selections from primary works in translation (The Platform Sutra of

This course looks at how gender has shaped Buddhism as well as how Buddhism has shaped gender. Most generally, it considers the myriad ways that Buddhist
soteriology and practice produce the very gender differences they purport to overcome. How have the Buddha and his far-flung disciples institutionalized gender
differences in spite of their putative goal of transcending duality? We examine the varying experiences of women and men in Buddhist societies and literatures as
a lens by which to analyze the pervasive operation of social and gender hierarchy. Our analysis revolves around several interdependent themes. Finally we discuss
how well feminist and American revisions of Buddhism have transformed gender and other forms of difference. (1) How do female and male bodies become the
subject of a specific set of Buddhist gazes? What does Buddhist discourse say about the possibility of gaining enlightenment in the female body? (2) How do
gender divisions reflect deeper social divisions such as class and race in Buddhist discourse? (3) How have feminist deconstructions of Buddhism transformed
gender and social hierarchies in the contemporary world? This course fulfills the Exploring Diversity Initiative by seeking to theorize the ways that Buddhism has
produced and reinscribed gender differences and social hierarchies.

Scholars usually distinguish between three different religious traditions in East Asia: Buddhism, Confucianism, and Daoism (with Shinto standing in for Daoism
in the Japanese case). Yet, this tradition-based approach ignores the rich landscape of East Asian religion, which encompasses another world of gods and demons
only loosely connected with established institutions. Even today, at popular sites all over China, Taiwan, Japan and Korea, people offer incense to a heterogeneous
collection of supernatural entities-sometimes called gods, goddesses, demons, immortals, ancestors or even buddhas. The "same" entity can be simultaneously a
beneficent god to one group and a malevolent demon to another. Rather than being static, this rich tapestry is constantly in evolution, elevating historical heroes
(or philosophers) to godhood, while other once popular deities are demoted and dismissed as monsters. This course will address this stratum of "popular" religion
in East Asia. Focusing on contemporary scholarship on China and Japan, we will take a multi-disciplinary approach to this material to provide a very different
picture of East Asian religion as a lived tradition.

REL 270T Father Abraham: The First Patriarch (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
The figure of Abraham in the Hebrew scriptures is interesting for at least two reasons: he comes first and seems more universal rather than particular. He first
received the covenant and the promise of the land of Israel, but before the full revelation of the Torah to Moses. He fathers both the Jewish people and the Arabs
and the significance of that wider identity was later captured both by Christianity in the work of Paul and in the Qur'an where Muhammad identified with Abra-
ham as the prototypical and non-sectarian monotheist prophet. This course will trace the figure of Abraham by a close and multidisciplinary reading of the Jewish,
Pagan, Christian and Muslim sources on Abraham. Our task is not to decide on the historicity of Abraham, but rather to explore the history of the figure and his
continuing relevance for today in understanding Jewish/Christian/Muslim conflict and cooperation. We will begin with an intensive reading of the Genesis mate-
rial on Abraham (12-25), where the issues of idolatry and mono-theism, the covenant and circumcision, relations of the patriarch to his women and sons, and
primal model of faith all are articulated. We will then turn to later Jewish developments in the figure of Abraham in midrash and apocalypse. We will then explore
the view of Abraham in the classical world, the uses made of Abraham by Christianity as it broke from an emerging Rabbinic Judaism and the development of
Abraham's specific connection with the view of the afterlife. We will then treat the figure of Abraham in the Qur'an and later Islamic traditions. We will conclude
with an examination of the cult surrounding Abraham in the city of Hebron, a currently-contested site on the West Bank where we will consider the current
religious practice regarding Abraham by both Jews and Muslims. The purpose of this tutorial is to read closely a variety of primary religious texts and to explore
the variety of tools available for the reading of those texts.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: each student in the tutorial will write and present orally five 5- to 7-page essays every other week on the readings for the week and
a final 7- to 10-page essay. Students not presenting an essay will be responsible for offering an oral critique of the work of their colleague. Evaluation will be based

In this course we will examine themes of religious life such as ritual, sin, redemption, evil, magic, heresy, prophecy, faith and devotion as they appear as sources of
conflict and reflection in novels, poems and short stories from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Our task will be to consider first, how literary form can be
used as a tool to conceptualize religious experience, but second the ways in which literature, in its expressions of wonder and despair, converges or conflicts with
the aims of worship and religious performance, producing either modern sacrament or idol. Of the novels, stories and poems that we will read, some will arise
directly out of the Christian, Jewish and Islamic traditions, while others will have more explicitly tangential, or even heretical relations with these traditions. We
will consider a range of novelists from Dostoevsky to Cynthia Ozick and Orhan Pamuk and a range of poets from Gerard Manley Hopkins to Wallace Stevens
and Paul Celan. Assignments will be both critical and creative. You will be asked to think like a writer and a critic and thus to try your hand at writing a sestina as

these categories come to implicate each other? This course begins with these questions and explores how practices surrounding each term's imagination have
fostered the construction of the other term in the contexts of modernity, specifically across dynamics of power. While this course will focus on the relationships

explore the manufacturing of desire on which consumption must depend. We will critique the tired critiques of advertising and explore in more depth the neurotic
and erotic dimensions of the creation of desire for objects. We will then turn to some comparative and historical analysis contrasting the experience of shopping in
traditional bazaars and contemporary malls, as well as exploring the history of consumerism from the eighteenth century through the current phenomena of
globalization. Finally, we will explore the place of shopping in our collective imaginations, attending especially to the relation between the gendering of the
shopping experience and expressions of contempt and outrage toward consumerism, with a special focus on the discourse on Christmas in American society.

as: What are the cultural and social dynamics of globalization? What are the effects on the nature of the state and the political practices that take place in the global
world? What are its environmental consequences? We then shift to examining the role of culture in general and religion in particular, arguing that its renewed
relevance is a function of the socio-cultural transformations that globalization brings about, particularly the loss of community and the atomization of individuals
in an ever more inter-connected world. In this way, we come to understand some of the dominant features of the global age, the role of cultural differences and the
growing concern for questions of meaning and personal identity. We conclude by examining some of the perspectives created by the new religious expressions
that attempt to respond to this situation, from personal spiritual quests as manifested in interest in Buddhism, ecology or mountain climbing, to various forms of

This course examines some of the central questions raised by the study of the consciousness: the place of intentionality, the role of emotions, the relation with the
body, the nature of subjectivity, the scope of reflexivity, the nature of perceptual presence, etc. In confronting these difficult questions, we do not proceed purely
theoretically but consider the contributions of various observation-based traditions, from Buddhist psychology and meditative practices to phenomenology to
neurosciences. We begin by examining some of the central concepts of Buddhist psychology, its treatment of the mind as a selfless stream of consciousness, its
examination of the variety of mental factors and its accounts of the relation between cognition and affects. We also introduce the practice of meditation as a way to
observe the mind and raise questions concerning the place of its study in the mind-sciences. We pursue this reflection by examining the views of James, Husserl,
Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, particularly as they concern the methods for the study of the mind and the relation between consciousness, reflexivity and the body. In
this way, we develop a rich array of analytical tools and observational practices to further our understanding of the mind. But we also question the value of these
tools based on first person approaches by relating them to the third person studies of the mind. In this way, we come to appreciate the importance of considering
the biology on which mental processes are based and the light that this approach throws on the nature of consciousness. We conclude by considering the relation
between first and third person studies of the mind, focusing on the concept of the embodied mind as a fruitful bridge between these different traditions.

In terms of vocabulary and metaphor, the Jewish experience of exile pervades modern, western discourse on the experience of being alienated, severed, and
separated from one's national and natural homeland. Thus in this course we will take the Jewish experience of exile (galut) as our point of departure for a broader
discussion of these themes as they relate to other diasporic communities. As a consequence of increased mobility, political instabilities, economic insecurity and
the proliferation of means of communication, the state of Diaspora increasingly characterizes populations across the globe, from Africa, Asia, South America, and
Europe. While we will not focus specifically on these communities, one of our tasks will be to discover how the Jewish experience shapes the discourse on exile
and Diaspora that pervades modern discussions of displacement and emigration. We must further consider what is at stake politically and philosophically in
privileging the Jewish experience, especially given the post-1948 community of Palestinian refugees. To illuminate this discussion we will draw on the literature
of the Jewish tradition from the Hebrew Bible and rabbis to Twentieth Century accounts and reflections of Franz Kafka, Walter Benjamin and Emmanuel Levi-
nas, as well as materials that reflect the voices of other refugee communities. We will then move to examine the relationship of the notion of the homeland to that
of the promised land. We will consider the ambivalence in the nineteenth and twentieth century concerning discourse of blood and soil, and the consequent
possibility that exile and rootlessness could signal positively.

"My general theory since 1971 has been that the Word is literally a virus, and that it has not been recognized as such because it has a achieved a state of relatively
stable symbiosis with its human host." (William S. Burroughs 1986, 47). Parallel movements in continental European and Anglo-American philosophy (known
popularly as "the linguistic turn") led to an interdisciplinary emphasis on the way in which language constitutes reality. Language could no longer be thought of as
simply a mechanism for the transmission of "facts." Increasingly, theorists recognized that differences in language created incommensurable worlds of meaning;
that specialized forms of linguistic discourse are both determined by and constitutive of their putative objects. Accordingly, linguistic phenomena have taken
center stage not only in philosophy, but also in the study of culture and society. The influx of these new theories of language has also dramatically reshaped the
discipline of religious studies. By examining the linguistic turn and its implications for the study of cultural phenomena, this course will introduce advanced
262
students to some of the most important theoretical approaches to come out of this movement. Authors whose work will be considered include: Ludwig Wittgens-

As thinkers of the 20th century came to question the Enlightenment ideal of human self-sovereignty, both for its intellectual and political consequences, many
turned back to religious imagery and concepts in pursuit of alternate modes of conceptualizing the human being. This course will examine some such endeavors
in the fields of philosophy, psychoanalysis and literature. While none of the texts we examine will be explicitly theological, all will, in some form or another, make
use of theological notions such as revelation, redemption, or sacrifice. In examining these texts we will be asking some fundamental questions: What meaning do
religious concepts have when emptied of dogmatic content? How effective are these concepts when employed in the service of cultural critique? How might such
efforts reflect back on the theorizing and practice of religions in contemporary society? We will, furthermore, analyze the very category of the post-modern by
considering its relationship to the Enlightenment, debating whether this relationship is one of continuity, rupture or both, and dissecting the critique that post-mod-
ern philosophy's concern for religion is a sign of its nostalgic or reactionary nature. Readings will include Immanuel Kant's Religion within the Limits of Reason

examine through the critiques of Derrida, Foucault and Said. With Derrida we learn the critical tools and the rigor necessary to question some of the central
notions such as identity and difference which are often taken for granted. With Foucault we question the relation between truth and power in interpretation, and
thematize the complexities of power. With Said's Orientalism, a seminal description of the ways in which the West has (mis)represented the "East," we examine
the nature of (mis)interpretation of other cultures and the role that ethnocentrism has played in the formation of modernity. We also consider some of the more
compelling critiques of Said's work such as Bhabha's warning against the essentialization of difference and Spivak's argument against the often too easy ap-
propriation of cultural differences. We conclude by considering two concrete situations in India and Egypt which illustrate the relevance of the post-colonial
critique and its main proponents, Said, Spivak and Bhabha (otherwise known as the "Holy Trinity"). Reading list: H.G. Gadamer, Truth and Method. F. Saussure,

REL 305 (formerly 284) Foucault (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
Michel Foucault was first and foremost a scholar of power. His ironic "genealogies" of how the Enlightenment promised freedom but instead delivered intricate
and perilous technologies of control have inspired philosophers, intellectual historians, and even novelists. Yet for all of this Foucault is often thought of as having
posited a helpless subject trapped in an inescapable web. Worse, scholars such as Rosie Braidotti have seen this subject as a uniquely masculine maneuver-ignor-
ing women's struggles. This course will consider Foucault and his own "mentors," Heidegger, Nietzsche, and Kant, among others, as well as exploring such
central questions as Foucault's views on gender and sexuality. We will also examine whether Foucault was able--as he intended--to move beyond "resistance"
in his later writings and help post-Enlightenment individuals engender a more empowered sense of subjectivity.

What does feminist theory have to offer the study of religion? How have participants in various religious traditions helped to produce and enact feminisms?
Feminisms and religion have a long though often troubled history of interconnection. In this course, we shall explore a range of feminist theoretical analyses that
have either emerged out of particular religious contexts or have been applied to the study of religious traditions and practices. We shall consider how conflicts
within feminism-especially those pertaining to issues of sexuality, race, class, nationality, ethnicity, and religious affiliation-make a difference for the ways that
religion is interpreted and practiced. Satisfies the Women's and Gender Studies theory requirement for the major.

REL 307 Thinking Gods: Cognitive Theories of Religion (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Although it is still in its infancy, the so-called "cognitive turn" has already become one of the most exciting contemporary developments in the study of religion.
During the past twenty years, scholars influenced by cognitive science have begun to formulate new models and challenge old assumptions about human religios-
ity and its relationship to the mind. In so doing, they have articulated theories about the evolutionary origins of religious concepts, reassessed the role of memory
and of counterintuitive explanations in the perpetuation of religious ideas, and developed new concepts such as "theological incorrectness" and "systematic
anthropomorphism." By examining the cutting-edge work produced by members of this movement on both sides of the Atlantic, this seminar for advanced
students will trace the historical roots of the cognitive turn and introduce some of its most important recent products. Authors to be considered include Sigmund
Freud, Ludwig Feuerbach, Jean-Pierre Dupuy, D. Jason Slone, Pascal Boyer, Veikko Anttonen, Scott Atran, Richard Dawkins, Dan Sperber, and Ilkka Pyysii-
nen.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active participation, class presentations, short writing assignments, and a take-home final exam.
Prerequisites: Religion 101 or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit 19 (expected: 15). Preference given to Religion majors and Cognitive Science concentra-

REL 308(F) Nietzsche and Religion
Few thinkers have been as controversial or as outspoken about religion as the nineteenth century German theorist/philologist Friedrich Nietzsche. His work was
not understood during his lifetime, or so he thought, and there are definitely controversies surrounding the way the writings of Nietzsche ought to be applied in the
early twenty-first century. We will see Nietzsche as a lonely curmudgeon who hated his rigid, Lutheran upbringing, as well as his sister, Elisabeth Frster-
Nietzsche. But we will also see the many fruitful dialogues created by his fractured personality and vitriolic books which, perhaps despite his intentions, speak to
religion in both a destructive and constructive way, as well as to later thinkers.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will consist of two 5- to 6-page response papers, a midterm exam, and a 10- to 15-page final paper, and thoughtful participation.

FRENCH
MAJOR--French Language and Literature
The French major seeks to provide training in literary and cultural analysis and linguistic expression through the study of selected texts from the French-speak-
ing world. Emphasis is placed on the changes in form and subject matter from the early modern period to the contemporary era.
The major consists of nine courses above the 102 level. One of these courses must be the 400-level capstone seminar during the senior year.
Students entering the major program at the 200-level may, with the permission of the Department, choose as part of their major program, one course in Art
History, History, Philosophy, Comparative Literature or other subjects that relate to and broaden their study of French. Students entering the major program at a
very advanced level may, in some cases and with the permission of the Department, include two such courses in their major program.
Working with the major advisor, the student will formulate a curricular plan that will ensure balance and coherence in courses taken. Such balance and coher-
ence will be based on the above areas of literary and cultural investigation. Prospective majors should discuss their program with the major advisor by the end of
their sophomore year. This is especially imperative for students who are planning to spend a part or all of their junior year in France.
Inasmuch as all courses in French assume the active participation of each student in discussions conducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class
meetings is expected.
MAJOR--French Studies
The major in French Studies is an interdisciplinary program that provides students with the opportunity to acquire skills and knowledge embracing the cultural,
historical, social, and political heritage of France and the Francophone world. The program allows for an individualized course of study involving work in several
departments and the opportunity to study abroad.
Students electing the French Studies major should register with the French Studies faculty advisor during their sophomore year. At that time they should
submit a feasibility plan that articulates their projected program.
The French Studies major consists of ten courses satisfying the following requirements:
1) at least three courses in French language and/or literature above the French 102 level;
2) a senior seminar;
3) Electives: The remaining courses needed to complete the major must be drawn from at least three different departments and relate primarily to an aspect of
the culture, history, society, and politics of France and the Francophone world. These courses will be selected in consultation with members of the Department of
Romance Languages. Appropriate electives might include:
History 331 The French and Haitian Revolutions
Religion 301 Psychology of Religion
All courses in French literature and language above the 103 level.
4) at least two literature courses that are taught in French.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN FRENCH
Honors candidates are required to have maintained a GPA of 3.5 in the major to qualify for submitting a thesis proposal.
By May 15th of their junior year, candidates will have found a thesis advisor, and given the Department a three- to five-page proposal and a preliminary
bibliography. (In some cases, and upon consultation with the Department, candidates will have the option to choose a second reader in addition to their primary
advisor; for example, when the thesis is interdisciplinary enough in nature that it requires the expertise of an additional reader).
This proposal will be discussed by the Department; by June 1st, the candidate will be informed whether he/she can proceed with the thesis, and if so, what
changes need to be made to the focus and scope of the project. The summer before the senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and
reading.
Upon their return to Williams, candidates will devote to their theses two semesters of independent study (beyond the nine courses required for the major) and
the winter study period of their senior year (493-W31-494). The thesis will be written in French and will usually not be shorter than fifty pages. By the end of the
Fall semester, students will normally have a clear outline of the project, have done substantial research, and produced the draft of at least the first half of the
project. During January this draft will be suitably rewritten and edited with a view to a final version, while the candidates will also begin work on remaining
chapters.
Candidates will submit what they have written to the department on the last day of Winter Study.
On the Tuesday of the first week of the spring semester candidates will make a presentation of the project at a departmental colloquium in French. The thesis
will be promptly discussed and evaluated to determine whether or not the student should continue in the honors program. The second semester of independent
thesis work will be spent writing more chapters, as well as revising, rewriting, and polishing the project where necessary. The completed thesis in its final form
will be due on April 25th. At the end of the Spring term, the student will present and defend the final project before members of the Department and others by
invitation. The grade will be awarded once members of the Department have consulted after the defense.
THE CERTIFICATE IN FRENCH
The Certificate in French Language and Cultures consists of a sequence of seven courses for which the student must earn a cumulative grade average of B or
higher. In addition, the student must take a proficiency test and achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the department once a year during
the month of April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those interested should express their intent to the chair of the department by March 1 or
earlier.
For students with no prior study of French, the course sequence will consist of RLFR 101-102, RLFR 103, RLFR 104, and three additional courses, with at
least one of these at the 200-level or higher taken at Williams. For students starting the sequence at RLFR 103, five additional courses must be taken, including at
least three French courses at the 200-level or higher. For all students starting at the French 103 level or higher, two electives may be taken in other departments:
one elective should be in French or Francophone culture (art, literature, theatre, music) and the other in French or Francophone civilization (history, political
science).
See French Studies Major description above for list of possible electives in other departments.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in French is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming first-year students who register for any French course
above the 101-102 level must take this test, regardless of their previous preparation.
STUDY ABROAD
French majors are strongly advised to complete part of the requirements for the major by studying abroad either during the academic year or the summer. Most
American study-in-France programs require applicants to have completed a fifth-semester, college-level French course (French 105, for example) before they go
abroad. A special affiliation with the Hamilton Junior Year in France program enables Williams students (who have completed 105) to participate in a compre-
hensive academic and cultural experience in a French-speaking environment. Credit for up to four courses towards the major can be granted at the discretion of
the Department: normally 2 major credit for one semester and up to 4 major credits for a full year or two semesters. The final assignment of credit will be
authorized in consultation with the student's major advisor once the student has returned to Williams. Such credits can only be determined by review of course
format, course materials, and evidence of satisfactory academic performance. Students interested in studying abroad need to consult with faculty members in
French by the second semester of their first year. Early planning is essential. Because the academic quality of certain programs of study in France may well be
beneath the pedagogical standards normally associated with a Williams education, students will receive major credit for only those programs recommended by
the Department. Please consult a faculty member to find out which programs are acceptable. Normally, the Department does not administer proficiency exams
(for study abroad) to any student who has not completed a French course at Williams.

RLFR 105(F) Advanced French: Linguistic and Cultural Intrigue in the Francophone World (I)
What mysterious set of connections brings together a young Qubecoise graduate student, an 18th-century French manuscript by the author of Dangerous Liai-
sons, a chameleon-like Parisian bent on tracking the young student, a sinister French police inspector, and a suave Caribbean book collector with roots in two
continents? Where is the kaleidoscope of cultural signs leading us: the Zydeco culture of Louisiana and New Orleans, enigmatic Creole proverbs such as "The
green beans are not salted" and "Okra is not eaten with one finger", the dizzying shift of international locales, and the autumnal radiance of Paris? We set out with
Claire Plouffe and her young, somewhat sinister admirer, Jean-Louis Royer, through a deepening international mystery set in a Francophone environment and
embracing the rich variety of cultural and linguistic experience that has helped shape the role of France in the world. Against this backdrop, the course seeks to
build on the writing, reading, and aural comprehension skills in French developed at the elementary and intermediate levels (especially those of French 103). It
will consist of a continued review of fundamental grammar structures, but will emphasize the application and assimilation of those structures in activities of
composition, oral presentation, and discussion. Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, attendance, short papers, and five hour-long exams.
Prerequisites: French 101-102, 103, or examination placement. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20).

RLFR 106(S) Advanced French: Linguistic and Cultural Intrigue in the Francophone World (II)
The plot thickens as Claire Plouffe's quest takes her and Jean-Louis Royer to the lush tropical climes of Fort-de-France in Martinique, to the relaxed multi-cultural
setting of Sngal and French West Africa, on to the homey comforts of Geneva and Switzerland, the rustic, lavender-laden ambience of Provence and the South
of France, and finally, the vertiginous return to Quebec and the unraveling and resolution of the enigma. Now, the range of cultural signs is even more disparate,
from the disquieting confrontations with colonialism and racial injustice, the aspirations of ngritude, the animist spirituality of African culture, the linguistic and
political independence of the Suisse Romande, and the ancient sense of linguistic and cultural autonomy that has helped shape Provence's distinctiveness within
the unity that is France. As the mystery reaches its dnouement, the unraveling leads to a series of revelations that shed light on the tales of murder, treachery,
betrayal, and purported forgery that have served as the backdrop to Claire's long quest for the mysterious manuscript. This course continues the basic structure,
goals and methodology developed in RLFR 105. It assumes active familiarity with the French present, compound past, imperfect, and subjunctive tenses, as well
as with most of the basic irregular verbs. Its focus continues to highlight writing, reading, and aural comprehension skills in the context of multi-cultural inter-
pretation and grammar review. Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, attendance, short papers, and five hour-long exams.
Prerequisites: French 101-102, 103, 105 or examination placement. Enrollment limit: 20 (expected: 20). Preference given to students continuing from RLFR 105

LITERATURE COURSES
RLFR 201(F) (formerly RLFR 109) Introduction to French Literature: Les Routes Jalonnes: Culture and Society in the French and
Francophone Literary Heritage
This course introduces students to the richly diverse literary landscape of metropolitan and non-metropolitan France as recorded in major works of prose, poetry,
and theater from the Middle Ages to the present. Particular attention will be given to the ways in which culture, society, and the individual's relationship to them
are mirrored and interpreted in various literary genres, contexts, and registers. Each work to be studied develops a unique language that serves not only to interpret
the culture from which it emerges, but to frame that culture within the larger issues of self and identity. Among the authors and works to be examined are Chrtien
de Troyes's Perceval (excerpts), La Chanson de la Rose (excerpts), selected sonnets by Ronsard, Molire's Le Misanthrope, Rousseau's Rveries d'un prome-
neur solitaire (excerpts), France's national anthem La Marseillaise (Rouget de Lisle), Flaubert's Madame Bovary, poems of Hugo and Baudelaire, short stories of
Gustave Flaubert and Albert Camus, Mariama B's Une si longue lettre, Linda L's Lettres mortes (selections), Honor Beaugrand's La Chasse-galerie, and, last
but not least, the comic pachyderm, Babar. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, three short papers, an oral presentation and a final examination.

RLFR 202(S) (formerly 110) War and Resistance: Two Centuries of War Literature in France, 1804-2004 (Same as Women's and Gender
Studies 201)
In 1883, Maupassant called on his fellow war veterans and writers to join him in speaking out against warfare and violence, crying "Let us dishonor war!" From
the Gallic Wars against Caesar (during the first century BC) to France's controversial role in the "War on Terror" (at the opening of the twenty-first century), the
French literary tradition is rich in texts that bear witness to war and speak out against its monstrous inhumanity. While war literature in France can be traced back
to ancient and medieval texts on Vercingtorix, Charlemagne, William the Conqueror, and Joan of Arc, this course will focus specifically on literary representa-
tions of war during the nineteenth- and twentieth-centuries, from the Napoleonic Wars, to the First and Second World Wars, to the Algerian and Cold Wars, and
the "War on Terror." Discussions will examine the impact of war on soldiers and civilians, patriotism and pacifism, history and memory; the implications of war
as invasion and conquest, occupation and resistance, victory and defeat; the relationship of war to gender, sexuality, and ethnicity; and the role of war in colonial-
ism and genocide. Readings to include novels, short stories, and poems by Balzac, Stendhal, Hugo, Rimbaud, Daudet, Maupassant, Zola, Cocteau, Wiesel, Duras,
Camus, and Fanon. Films to include works by Resnais, Renoir, Malle, Angelo, Pontecorvo, and Duras. Conducted in French.

RLFR 203(F) (formerly 111) Introduction to Francophone Studies (Same as Africana Studies 204) (D)
Literature in French comes from several far-flung regions of the world, including Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the Caribbean and the Americas. This
course asks first of all: what links such disparate francophone cultures besides a shared language and a history of colonialism? A common thread that runs through
francophone literature is the coming-of-age story, where the process of growing up and traveling far from home involves or parallels the assimilation of regionally
specific or traditional culture to a Western standard. The class readings will include coming-of-age narratives from four francophone regions by Dany Laferrire
(Haiti), Mouloud Feraoun (Algeria), Fatou Diome (Senegal), and Gabrielle Roy (Canada), as well as shorter pieces by authors such as Aim Csaire (Marti-
nique), Frantz Fanon (Martinique), and Henri Lopes (Congo). As a class we will debate to what extent these narratives can or should be read as allegories of
nation-building or representations of specific cultures on the one hand and as unique, idiosyncratic works of fiction on the other. These works will also invite
students to consider the nature of cultural difference, the treatment of gender and race in fiction and the interrelatedness of themes such as family, migration and
diaspora. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, reading journal, two short papers, and a final paper
Prerequisites: French 105 or above or results of the College Placement Examination, or permission of instructor. Preference given to French and Comparative

RLFR 204 The Spirit of the Renaissance: Rediscovery and Invention (Not offered 2009-2010)
The seminar will examine the literary culture of France in the sixteenth century through selected masterworks of poetry and prose. During the age that marks the
transition between the Middle Ages and neoclassicism, French society is engaged in a process of vigorous experimentation in such themes and issues as individu-
alism, spontaneity, inspiration, eroticism, literary genre, poetics, the visual arts, and social conflict. We will give particular attention to the shift from oral to printed
culture and the setting of individual works within the context of modern theories of language and writing. Authors to be studied: Rabelais, Du Bellay, Ronsard,
and Montaigne. Conducted in French.
Requirements: class participation, two short papers, an oral presentation, and a final exam.

RLFR 208 Fatal Passions and Happy Fools: French Theater in the Age of Louis XIV (Same as Comparative Literature 208) (Not offered
2009-2010)
The plays of the three great French dramatists of the seventeenth century--Corneille, Molire, Racine--are mirrors through which a rich tapestry of moral and
intellectual issues, notions about art and aesthetics, social norms and aberrations, and meditations on the human condition are finely woven and exhaustively
reflected. In an age emblematized by the solar absolutism of the "Sun King", comedy and tragedy engage critical minds in searching questions on what consti-
tutes heroism, duty, fatality, hypocrisy, social conformity and marginality. No area of literature engages, perhaps, in more sustained interrogation, even subversion,
of the stifling authority of Versailles and the Court than do the genres of tragedy and comedy. They are texts that interpret not only the tragic vision of the individu-
al acting out his or her part in a universe where the gods remain silent spectators, but also the comic vision of salons inhabited by a typology of misfits, puffers and
fops, the happy fools of gilt and glitter. This course will examine these issues through some of the masterpieces of dramatic literature from this period, including
Corneille's Le Cid and Horace, Molire's Tartuffe, Le Misanthrope, and Les Prcieuses ridicules, and Racine's Phdre and Andromaque. These plays will be
studied and discussed in the context of French society, art, and the theological, intellectual, and political thought of seventeenth-century France. The performance
of certain plays will be observed directly through cinematic productions. Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: class participation, two shorter papers, one longer paper, and an oral presentation.
Prerequisite: French 201, 202, 203, or permission of instructor.Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15 ). Preference will be given to French majors and those with
compelling justification for admission.

RLFR 210 Fantastic Spaces and Imaginary Places: Literary Text and Image in Late Medieval and Early Modern France (Not offered
2009-2010)
When Aristotle speaks of Homer's powers of language, he describes the Poet's skill as a dimension of energy and eye, the capacity to "represent everything as
moving and living" and thus to be "graphic", to make the audience actually see things through words. Medieval and Renaissance French writers based their
literary projects on these ancient theories of visualization and presentation. The result was a period of intense literary creativity that encompasses a kaleidoscope
of issues converging both on poetics and painting as well as on concepts of architectural and landscape design. This capacity to imagine is at the heart of writing
about travel, exploration, discovery, spatial and natural description, phantasmagoric quests, poetic "madness", and the contemplation of mind. The primary ve-
hicle through which we will examine these issues is the literary text and its supporting manuscript illuminations and book illustrations: namely, selected texts from
Guillaume de Lorris' and Jean de Meung's Roman de la Rose and the allegory of love, Guillaume Du Bellay's Antiquits de Rome and Regrets, Franois Rabe-
lais's grotesque epic of Gargantua and Pantagruel, and Pierre de Ronsard's sonnet cycles on love and nature (Les Amours). We will examine how these overarch-
ing literary issues intersect with parallel developments in the visual arts (Burgundy in the 15th century, the Myth of the Golden Age, The School of Fontainebleau,
Clouet), ecclesiastical and domestic architecture, including the development of the chteau, landscape and garden design and its allegorical configurations. Con-
ducted in French.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: class participation, two 7-page papers, a midterm examination, and an oral presentation.
Prerequisites: French 201, 202, 203, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected 10). If overenrolled, preference given to French and Comparative

RLFR 226 Contemporary Short Stories from North Africa: Fast Cars, Movies, Money, Love and War (Same as Africana Studies 226)
(Not offered 2009-2010)
Today the countries of North Africa are experiencing rapid social change. Rap music can be heard spilling out of windows while television sets broadcast a call to
prayer. In the market place, those selling their goods compete to be heard over the ringing of cell-phones. Old and new exist side by side, albeit sometimes very
uncomfortably. During the past decade, literature has emerged in both French and Arabic examining the effects of globalization: unequal modernization, unem-
ployment, cultural change and cultural resistance. In this course, we will read short stories that address these issues as well as analyze films, sociological texts and
Moroccan, Algerian and Tunisian newspapers on the web in order to explore contemporary transformations of life in North Africa. Readings by Maissa Bey,
Abdelfattah Kilito, Zeina Tabi, Mohamed Zafzaf, Ahmed Bouzfour, Soumaya Zahy and Abdelhak Serhane among others. Conducted in French.
Requirements: active class participation, reading journal, two short papers, an oral presentation and a final paper.

2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (D)
In 1857, both Flaubert's Madame Bovary and Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal were put on trial for sexual indecency and "crimes against public morality." In 1868,
Le Figaro attacked Zola's novel Thrse Raquin as "putrid literature" for its depiction of adultery, murder, and scandalous sexuality in nineteenth-century Paris. A
century later, Gide, Colette, and Duras continued to shock French readers with their extraordinary novels on male and female homosexuality, inter-generational
lovers, and bi-racial relationships. In this course, we will examine a wide range of issues on eroticism and sexuality in nineteenth- and twentieth-century French
literature, including marriage and adultery, seduction and desire, love and betrayal, prostitution and fetishism, gay and lesbian identity, cross-dressing and gender
representation, exoticism and colonial (s)exploitation. Readings to include novels, shorts stories, and poems by Chateaubriand, Constant, Duras, Balzac, Flaubert,
Baudelaire, Zola, Maupassant, Barbey d'Aurevilly, Gide, Proust, Colette, Duras, and Guibert. Conducted in French.

RLFR 312(F) Cannibalism and French Caribbean Literature (D)
Cannibalism and the Caribbean have been intertwined since 1492. The two words stem from the same root: Carib, the name of the people Columbus encountered
in his first voyage. For five hundred years, cannibalism has represented all that is opposed to the civilizing force of European colonialism and modernization. And
yet Caribbean writers have come to embrace a cannibal past by recuperating the idea of cannibalism as a metaphor for linguistic and literary appropriation. This
course will begin with the early portrayal of cannibalism in the greater Caribbean through readings including Jean de Lry's Histoire d'un voyage fait en la terre
du Brsil (1578), Montaigne's essay "Des cannibales" (1580), and Shakespeare's The Tempest (1611). Aim Csaire's adaptation of Shakespeare's play, Une
tempte (1968), bridges the early modern and the modern and introduces the theme of the rest of the course: namely, the development of a kind of literary canni-
balism by New World authors. We will read carefully three novels by two authors from the island of Guadeloupe: La migration des coeurs (1995) and Histoire de
la femme cannibale (2003) by Maryse Cond and L'isol soleil (1981) by Daniel Maximin. We will discuss to what extent these novels are cannibalistic, either of
European literature or of history, while engaging concepts such as difference vs. repetition, the value and possibility of originality, the limits of translation, and the
cultural effects of globalization. Rather than dismiss the cannibal as a sign of a savage past, this course asks: what can the cannibal teach us about the present and
the future? Conducted in French.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active class participation, weekly online reading responses, one midterm essay and one final paper.
Prerequisites: open to students who have taken a literature course in French at Williams, or permission of instructor, Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 15). Prefer-
ence given to French and Comparative Literature majors and concentrators in Africana Studies.

RLFR 314 Between the Two World Wars (Not offered 2009-2010)
The period from 1913 to 1939 was an adventurous time for the French novel. In this course, we will study novels by Gide, Proust, Colette, Camus, Martin du
Gard, Mauriac, Malraux, and Sartre. Although there is great diversity among these authors, they were all reacting to the aftermath of the First World War and the
breakdown of traditional French culture. Through the popular character of the rebellious adolescent, they experimented with revolt against the stifling social order
of Church and family. The real challenge of the period, however, concerned not a break with the past or discoveries of new levels of consciousness and freedom,
but rather the mature acceptance of responsibility for the future and the articulation of fresh spiritual and political visions. Conducted in French. Requirements:
several short papers and oral class presentations.
Prerequisites: any French literature course or permission of the instructor.

RLFR 316(S) (formerly 214) Paris on Fire: Incendiary Voices from the City of Light (1830-2005) (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 315)
During the 1830s, Balzac described Paris as a "surprising assemblage of movements, machines, and ideas, a city of one hundred thousand novels, the head of the
world," but also characterized the French capital as a "land of contrasts," a "monstrous wonder," a "moral sewer." Similarly, writers from Hugo to Zola have
simultaneously celebrated Parisian elegance and condemned the appalling misery of Paris's urban poor. Since 1889, Paris has been fted as the "City of Light" for
its Enlightenment legacy, its Eiffel Tower modernity, and its luminous urban energy, captured in countless paintings, photographs, and film. However, Paris is also
the historical site of revolution, resistance, and riots. From revolutionary revolt (1830, 1848, 1871), to wartime resistance (1870, 1914-18, 1940-44), to reformist
and race riots (1968 and 2005), Paris has repetitively sparked with incendiary passion and political protest. As fires raged during the recent riots in 2005, many
heard the echo of Hitler's ominous 1944 question, "Is Paris burning?" and asked: why was Paris burning again at the dawn of the twenty-first century? To answer
this question, we will examine the social, political, and literary landscape of Paris during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, from urbanization and modern-
ization, to occupation and liberation, to immigration and globalization. Readings to include poetry, short stories, and novels by Hugo, Balzac, Baudelaire, Mau-
passant, Verne, Zola, Apollinaire, Colette, Duras, Perec, Rochefort, and Charef. Films to include works by Clair, Truffaut, Godard, Minnelli, Clment, Lelouch,
Luhrmann, Kassovitz, Besson, and Jeunet. Conducted in French.

RLFR 370(S) Displaying, Collecting and Preserving the Other: Museums and French Imperialism (Same as Africana Studies 370 and

This course will explore relationships between culture and imperialism in France by exploring how the "Other" has been conceived, displayed and collected in
French museums, world's fairs and galleries from the 19th century to the present. Through readings in museum history and theory, we will explore the imperial
histories of the Louvre and the Muse de l'Homme, the role of Parisian World's Fairs in ordering the colonial world, French colonial photography and the creation
a body of consumable subjects, and the discourse of collection and preservation in French colonial architecture. In addition, we will read French novels that
address the display, collection and preservation of the colonial Other such as Balzac's Le Cousin Pons and Leila Sebbar's Shrazade. Drawing on museum theory,
we will also critically examine contemporary Parisian museums such as the Muse du Quai Branly, the Institut du Monde Arabe and the Cit nationale de
l'histoire de l'immigration. This course will be conducted in English. For students seeking RLFR credit, select readings will be in French, and written work will be

RLFR 408(S) Senior Seminar: Mortal Combat and Wounded Hearts: Codes of Honor, Love, and Quest in Medieval and Early Modern
French Literature
French literature and literary language could be said to begin with the 11th-12th-century epic, La Chanson de Roland, a narrative of knightly audacity, betrayal,
and fraternal love centered on Charlemagne's campaign in Saracen Spain and the monumental defeat of his bravest knight, Roland, at Roncevaux. The Chanson
de Roland inaugurates an exciting and uplifting literary cycle that is both an artistic and a cultural window on the Middle Ages and its narrative traditions. This
cycle encompasses such works as Chrtien de Troyes's narrative romances Yvain ou le Chevalier au Lion, Lancelot ou le Chevalier de la Charrette, and the
unfinished Perceval ou le Conte du Graal. During a period often associated with great spiritual and moral orthodoxy, authors are not reluctant to entwine epic
narrative with the issues of adultery, interracial love, and sexual emancipation as in Chrtien's Lancelot and in the 13th-century romance Aucassin et Nicolette, a
tale of adventure centered on a Christian knight in love with a Saracen slave girl. The motifs of heroism and love culminate later on in the encyclopedic Roman de
le Rose, a medieval theme park that embraces a vigorous and licentious summons to live for love and to abandon all restraint. The unabashed sensual indulgence
of this work will be studied in relation to the pro-feminist history of women in Christine de Pisan's Le Livre de la Cit des dames (1405). This seminar will
examine many of the key literary, linguistic, and artistic aspects of this literary heritage, including the concepts of allegory, symbolic expression, invention, imagi-
nation, the evolution of the French language, and the corrosive way in which later Renaissance authors such as Rabelais interrogate the medieval tradition. All
readings will be in modern French. Conducted in French

RLFR 412 Senior Seminar: Desperate Housewives and Extreme Makeovers: Novel Approaches to the Nineteenth-Century Novel (Same
as Women's and Gender Studies 408) (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
In 1834, Balzac wrote that "Paris is a veritable ocean. Sound it: you will never know its depth." The same can be said of the French nineteenth-century novel and
its boundless ability to echo the historical past and reverberate in the cultural present. Desperate housewives, sex in the city, queer eyes for straight guys, and
extreme makeovers fill the pages of the nineteenth-century novel. From the Romanticism of Stendhal and Hugo, and the Realism of Balzac and Flaubert, to the
Naturalism of Maupassant and Zola, the novel became an extraordinary forum for examining illicit sexuality, institutional misogyny, social injustice, criminal
passions, revolutionary struggles, and Parisian pleasures in nineteenth-century France. Characters such as the imprisoned housewife Emma Bovary, the reluctant
revolutionary Jean Valjean, the social-climbing lover Julien Sorel, the ambitious undergraduate Rastignac, the domestically-abused Gervaise, and the man-eating
courtesan Nana became synonymous with France's turbulent social and political landscape from the 1830s to the 1880s. And as recent film adaptations make
clear, these characters continue to haunt our twenty-first century present. Reinterpreted by such contemporary actors as Grard Depardieu, Isabelle Huppert, Uma
Thurman, Claire Danes, and Jennifer Aniston, the nineteenth-century novel continues to sound out the scandalous and sensational depths of our own century.

SPANISH
The Spanish major consists of nine courses above the 103-104 level. These nine courses include 301, any 200 level or above (excluding RLSP 205 and RLSP
303), and 403. Spanish majors should note that RLSP 301 is only offered in alternate years, and they are therefore required to plan their courses accordingly. One
200-level course must be completed at Williams. Other courses, taken at overseas programs, may be used to satisfy the requirements of the major, with approval
of the department. The Spanish faculty strongly suggests that students take 201 and 200 at some point in their studies, and especially recommends that they do so
before rather than after studying abroad.
The major seeks to provide training in literary analysis and linguistic expression, as well as an appreciation of Hispanic civilization, through the study of the
major writers of the Spanish-speaking world.
Students majoring in Spanish may replace one of their Spanish electives with a course in Comparative Literature, with one course in Latin-American Studies
that is 200-level or higher, or with a course in Linguistics.
Inasmuch as all courses in Spanish assume the active participation of each student in discussions conducted in the foreign language, regular attendance at class
meetings is expected.
Courses numbered in the 100s are language courses, with 105 and 106 combining grammar and literature. RLSP 200 and RLSP 201 focus on civilization and
culture, while other 200-level classes serve as gateway courses for literary study, in ascending order of difficulty; they are thus suitable for first-years and sopho-
mores. Courses in the 300s require both serious grounding in the study of literature and an advanced command of the language. The 400-level course offered
annually is the senior seminar, serving as "capstone course" to the Spanish major.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN SPANISH
Candidates for a senior thesis must have maintained a 3.5 GPA in the major by the time of proposal submission. Two alternative routes are available to those
who wish to apply for the degree with honors.
The first of these involves the writing of a senior thesis. Honors candidates are required to have maintained a GPA of 3.5 in the major to qualify for submitting a
thesis proposal.
By May 15th of their junior year, candidates will have found a thesis advisor, and given the Department a three- to five-page proposal and a preliminary
bibliography. (In some cases, and upon consultation with the Department, candidates will have the option to choose a second reader in addition to their primary
advisor; for example, when the thesis is interdisciplinary enough in nature that it requires the expertise of an additional reader).
This proposal will be discussed by the Department; by June 1st, the candidate will be informed whether he/she can proceed with the thesis, and if so, what
changes need to be made to the focus and scope of the project. The summer before the senior year will be spent compiling a more detailed bibliography and
reading.
Upon their return to Williams, candidates will devote to their theses two semesters of independent study (beyond the nine courses required for the major) and
the winter study period of their senior year (493-W31-494). The thesis will be written in Spanish and will usually not be shorter than fifty pages. By the end of the
Fall semester, students will normally have a clear outline of the project, have done substantial research, and produced the draft of at least the first half of the
project. During January this draft will be suitably rewritten and edited with a view to a final version, while the candidates will also begin work on remaining
chapters.
Candidates will submit what they have written to the department on the last day of Winter Study.
On the Tuesday of the first week of the spring semester candidates will make a presentation of the project at a departmental colloquium in Spanish. The thesis
will be promptly discussed and evaluated to determine whether or not the student should continue in the honors program. The second semester of independent
thesis work will be spent writing more chapters, as well as revising, rewriting, and polishing the project where necessary. The completed thesis in its final form
will be due on April 25th. At the end of the Spring term, the student will present and defend the final project before members of the Department and others by
invitation. The grade will be awarded once members of the Department have consulted after the defense.
269
The second route is a group of three clearly related courses (offered by the Department of Romance Languages or by other departments, such as History, Art,
Philosophy, English, etc.), only one of which may be counted in the nine courses comprising the major. One of the courses will be an Independent Study (plus
senior year WSP 030) in the spring of the senior year, at the end of which the student will write an essay that synthesizes the content of the three related courses.
Students may apply for this route by November 2 of the senior year.
In the case of both routes to the degree with honors, the department's recommendation for graduation with honors will be based on the originality and thor-
oughness of the finished project.
THE CERTIFICATE IN SPANISH
The Certificate in Spanish Language and Culture consists of a sequence of seven courses for which the student must earn a cumulative grade average of B or
higher. In addition, the student must take a proficiency test and achieve a score of "Advanced." The test will be administered by the department once a year during
the month of April to all students desirous of obtaining the Certificate. Those so interested should express their intent to the chair of the department by March 1 or
earlier.
For students with no prior Spanish background, the course sequence will consist of Spanish 101-102, Spanish 103 and 104, and three courses in Spanish above
the 104 level, with at least one of these courses at the 200-level or higher taken at Williams. If the student starts out the sequence at Spanish 103, in addition to the
three courses in Spanish beyond the 104 level (including a 200-level course or higher), two electives may be taken in other departments. One elective should be in
Spanish or Latin-American cultural history (art, literature, drama, music) and the other in Spanish or Latin-American intellectual, political, or social history.
Spanish 200, 201, or 208 can be counted for the elective requirement.
Electives may be considered from a variety of departments and programs. However, students should consult with the chair of Romance Languages before
making any enrollment decisions.
PLACEMENT
A placement test in Spanish is administered at Williams at the opening of the fall semester. Incoming first-year students who wish to register for any Spanish
courses above the 101 level must take this test.
STUDY ABROAD
Spanish majors, as well as non-majors interested in further exposure to the language and the culture, are strongly encouraged to include study in Spain or Latin
America as part of their program at Williams. Through its special ties with the Hamilton College Academic Year in Spain, the department offers a comprehensive
linguistic and cultural experience in a Spanish-speaking environment, for periods either of a semester or a year. Credit for up to four courses can be granted at the
discretion of the Department for study overseas. Students interested in study abroad should consult with a member of the department at their earliest convenience.

RLSP 202T 1898: Spain's Fin de Siglo and the Crisis of Ideas (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
In this tutorial we will read the works of some of modern Spain's influential writers from the late part of the nineteenth century and the first three decades of the
twentieth. Our aim is to understand how fiction and philosophy represented this significant time in Spain's history. The loss of the war with the U.S. in 1898, the
turbulent shifts of power within the country, Spanish regional identities, and the cultural and intellectual movements that shaped Spain on the eve of the Civil War

are among the key issues we will address. Our primary sources--largely fiction and poetry by artists such as Miguel de Unamuno, Azorn, Ramiro de Maezt,
Antonio Machado, Po Baroja--will be complemented with a rigorous study of the cultural landscape of Spain at that time. Our principal engagement with
philosophy will be through Jos Ortega y Gasset, in particular his output from the 1920s. Conducted entirely in Spanish.

RLSP 204 Icons and Imaginaries: Culture and Politics in Latin America (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (D)
This course provides an overview of Latin American culture and politics by focusing on some of the most recognizable names and faces from the continent's
turbulent history: Christopher Columbus, Hernn Corts and Malintzn, Simn Bolvar, Jos Mart, Pancho Villa, Eva Pern, Frida Kahlo, Che Guevara, Rigob-
erta Mench and Hugo Chvez. In addition to exploring the controversies surrounding each figure and her or his influence within a specific historical context,
we'll also unpack some of the overarching issues of Latin American culture and politics: How are nations and nationalism constructed through processes of
representation, and what roles do specific iconic figures play in that process? How can popular culture challenge elite representations of the nation and its heroes/
heroines, and how durable are the images it produces as expressions of collective will? What opportunities are available to women and sexual minorities in a
political culture that has been historically dominated by macho military types? This course fulfills the EDI requirement by enabling students to appreciate the
figures that have influenced generations of Latin American women and men and their sense of what is politically possible, while challenging the class to identify
the operations of power at work in the construction of the figures themselves.
Format: lecture/discussion. Assignments will include political and cultural essays, literature and films. Three 5-page papers. Conducted in Spanish.
Prerequisites: RLSP 105 or 106 or the equivalent. Enrollment limit: 21 (expected: 20). Preference given to Spanish majors and qualified first-year students.

RLSP 208 The Spanish Civil War in Literature and Film (Not offered 2009-2010)
The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) has generated a vast bibliography and filmography that to this day reflect widely antagonistic interpretations of the conflict
itself, its roots, and its impact. From the Spanish perspective, the war is the most important single event in understanding modern Spain. The ideals, passions, and
consequences of the Spanish Civil War still divide Spaniards and have been recreated and relived by writers, artists, and filmmakers, and debated by historians.
The course will begin with a historical introduction to the origins, development, and outcome of the war. Was the Spanish war a national struggle or an interna-
tional struggle played out on Spanish soil? Along with studying internal Spanish political divisions, we will also consider the impact of the foreign policy posi-
tions of other countries-including Germany, Italy, the United States, and Russia--vis-a-vis Spain, as well as the role of the thousands of foreign volunteers who
formed the International Brigades and came from all over the world to fight against Franco. With this historical basis, we will see how the themes and issues of the
war are reflected in Spanish poetry, short fiction, novels, and films from the time of the war up through the present day. Readings will include works by Ayala,
Cernuda, Neruda, Goytisolo, Sender, Fernan-Gomez, and Matute. Films will include documentaries as well as classic and contemporary features. Conducted in
Spanish.
Evaluations will be based on lively class participation, an oral report, short written assignments, and two papers.
Prerequisites: Spanish 111, permission of instructor, or results of the Williams College Placement Exam. Enrollment limit: 20.

RLSP 217 Love in the Spanish Golden Age (Not offered 2009-2010)
The principal focus of this course is the Spanish "comedia" of the seventeenth century (with supplemental readings from prose and poetry) to provide us with a
dynamic and critical understanding of the theme of love as constructed by the greatest dramatists and authors of the period. Works by Lope de Vega, Tirso de
Molina, Caldern, Cervantes, San Juan de la Cruz, and others will show us how the theme was treated from diverse perspectives, and how it related to key
concepts such as honor, religion, and artistic creativity. Conducted in Spanish.
Evaluation will be based on meaningful participation and frequent short written assignments with one longer composition.

RLSP 219 Humor in Spanish-American Literature (Not offered 2009-2010) (D)
From the sixteenth century to the twenty-first, humor has been an essential element of Spanish-American cultural discourse, frequently mixing entertainment with
sharp criticism of repressive political regimes and social institutions. This course will examine the role of humor in Spanish-American literature with emphasis on
the colonial period and the nineteenth century, considering the use of satire, parody and farce to diagnose social ills ranging from the oppression of indigenous and
African Americans to administrative corruption, promiscuity and sexual hypocrisy, and sadism among medical practitioners. Drawing on theorists including
Erasmus, Wylie Sypher and Mikhail Bahktin, we will discuss various categories of literary comedy and their functions as subversive or transgression discourses.
Spanish-American authors to be read may include Juan Rodrguez Freile, Sir Juana Ins de la Cruz, Catalina de Erauso, Juan del Valle Caviedes, Alonso Carri de
la Vandera, and Ricardo Palma. For students with little or no background in early Spanish-American literature, we will also read selected works of "serious,"
canonical literature. We will conclude by considering colonial and nineteenth-century satire as precursors of the anti-authoritarian discourse in contemporary texts
such as Gabriel Garca Mrquez's Los funerales de la Mam Grande.
Format: lecture. Evaluation will be based on contribution to class discussions, three short papers, and mid-term and final exams.

RLSP 220 Women in Twentieth-Century Spain (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 222) (Not offered 2009-2010)
From the early twentieth century to the present day, the radical changes in the lives of Spanish women have clearly reflected the tug of war between progress and
tradition in recent Spanish history.The dramatic upheavals in Spanish politics have marked and transformed the lives of women to such a great extent that one can
often gauge the political and social climate of any given historical moment by considering how the role of women was defined by the law, the Catholic church,
education, and other social and political institutions. Using literary and historical texts as well as films and graphic materials, this course will look at the trans-
formations in the public and private lives of Spanish women during the following periods: the turn of the century, the Second Republic, the Spanish Civil War, the
Franco years, and the transition to democracy.

RLSP 230T Violent States, Violent Subjects: Nation-Building and Atrocity in 19th-Century Latin America (Same as Comparative
Literature 230T) (Not offered 2009-2010) (W) (D)
Although the massive, mechanized wars of the 20th century often overshadow earlier conflicts, the 19th century was also a period of widespread bloodshed in
Latin America. Even after the carnage of the Independence Wars came to an end, the new republics continued some of the most violent pursuits of the colonial
period: indigenous people were conquered, their lands settled by whites or used for grazing cattle, and blacks (often despite the official abolition of slavery)
continued to suffer exclusion, oppression, and abuse. It was a century of civil wars (Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela) and of two bitter
international wars, the Paraguayan War(1864-1870), and the Pacific War (1879-1883), each of which would have a lasting impact on the countries involved. In
this tutorial we will explore the literary links between some of the violent conflicts listed above and the foundation of national identities in Latin America, reading
texts that probe the social and ethical implications of state-sponsored violence. Issues to be explored include militarism and the development of nationalism;
genocide and the national community; torture, truth and testimony; and the nature of"civilization." We will read a variety of 19th century texts by authors like
Rosa Guerra, Lucio V. Mansilla and Ricardo Palma; in addition we will also read a few contemporary texts, written in the aftermath of the most recent dictator-
ships in the Southern Cone and elsewhere, that actively reflect on the long history of state-sponsored violence in Latin America. This course fulfills the EDI
requirement by encouraging students to examine the ways that national identities have been constructed in Latin America (and, by extension,elsewhere) empha-
sizing the forms of violence that have been part of that process.
Format: tutorial. Students will decide whether they prefer to take the course in Spanish (for Spanish/COMP credit) or in English (for COMP credit). Students will
work in pairs throughout the semester, each group meeting with the instructor once a week. Each week one of the students will present a 5-page paper on the
assigned reading and the other will critique the paper orally.

RLSP 266(S) The Exemplary Short Fiction of Cervantes
This course will offer students the opportunity to read the short stories of Miguel de Cervantes (1547-1616): a collection of works collectively titled Las novelas
ejemplares. Attention will be given to the structure and design of the tales, the sociopolitical and literary context that shaped them, and the often unsettling
implications of Cervantes' approach to themes such as insanity, woman's honor, man's relationship to Nature and animals, and the place of representation in art
and life.
Format: seminar. Requirements: active and meaningful participation, two short papers, one final research paper. Conducted in Spanish.

RLSP 271 The Interaction of Three Religions and Cultures in Early Modern Spain (Same as Comparative Literature 265) (Not offered
2009-2010)
In this course we will study a number of key literary texts produced in the Medieval period and the Golden Age of Spain (approximately the 11th to the 17th
centuries). Throughout, our special focus will be on a feature that is often highlighted as unique to Spain: the co-existence of three religions and cultures on the
Iberian Peninsula over a period of at least eight-hundred years. We will analyze and critique the idea of the influence of one culture over another, the meaning of
co-existence, and the boundaries between hostility and entente, all as seen through the lens of literature. We will supplement our primary readings with theoretical
and historical analyses. Texts will include selections from Hebrew and Arabic literature produced in Spain, El Cid, El libro de buen amor, La Celestina, popular
and learned poetry, drama by Golden Age artists, short stories by Cervantes, writings by San Juan de la Cruz and Fray Luis de Len. Conducted in Spanish.
Format: seminar. Requirements: frequent short assignments, a final paper, and active and meaningful class participation.

RLSP 301 Cervantes' Don Quijote (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011) (W)
This course is an in-depth study of Cervantes' masterpiece Don Quijote. With this novel, Cervantes forever transformed the European literary landscape and the
future of prose fiction. We will consider the singularity of Cervantes' achievement from the perspectives of language, literature, and culture. The literary and
social background of the period will also shape our understanding of the work's historical context. Additional reading will include a selection of major critical
studies. Conducted in Spanish.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on meaningful class participation and 20-25 pages of writing divided into several discrete assignments, some of which

of Spanish. We will spend the semester exploring the array of themes and characters elaborated by Cervantes in his influential masterpiece, and we will make
connections to some of the many takes on Don Quixote in other literatures and media. Historical and theoretical information, as well as close reading, will shape
our understanding of this work of art which has left an impact on numerous European and American novels. Conducted in English.

RLSP 306T Latino Writing: Literature by U.S. Hispanics (Same as Comparative Literature 302T) (W)
Writing by U.S. Hispanics constitutes a new voice in American letters. In this tutorial, we will read and discuss work by U.S. Latinos and examine the social
backgrounds to their texts. The experiences of immigration and assimilation, and the specific complexities of being both Hispanic and North American will be
addressed. Authors to be studied: Jose Antonio Villarreal, Tomas Rivera, Richard Rodriguez, Sandra Cisneros, Rudolfo Anaya, Piri Thomas, Edward Rivera,
Oscar Hijuelos, Cristina Garcia, and historical texts by Carey McWilliams, and Rodolfo Acuna. Given the absence of a critical consensus around these recent
titles, our task is to gain some sense of their common traits as a tradition, and place them within the larger body of literature of the Americas and the world. The
tutorial will examine one work or set of authors per week. A student will bring, written out in full, an oral presentation focusing on the artistic features and
sociocultural content of the assigned reading. Questioning of the presenter, on the part of the second tutee and the tutor, will follow. The course is designed to
accommodate both Spanish and English speaking students. A student able to read and speak Spanish will be paired with another student of similar proficiency.
Students who neither read nor speak Spanish will be paired together.
Requirements: five short oral presentations/papers (about 20-25 minutes) and a final longer one (about 40-45 minutes).
Prerequisites: some previous course work in any literature beyond the 100 level is helpful. Students selecting the Spanish option for credit toward the Spanish
major must have taken at least one 200-level Spanish course or seek permission of the tutor.

RLSP 308 Foundations of Latin American Literature: Colonialism and Post-Coloniality (Not offered 2009-2010) (D)
This course offers a survey of major Latin American writers from the beginning to 1900: we will read some of the most significant chronicles of first contact and
the conquest, work by Sor Juana Ins de la Cruz and other writers from the colonial period, and important texts from the wars of independence and early national
era. The first half of the course, focusing on the period from 1492 to 1800, will examine some of the artistic forms that emerged in response to colonization and the
increasingly heterogeneous polities of Spanish America. In the second half of the term we explore a few of the ways that 19th-century intellectuals revisited these
tropes and ideas in shaping the identities of the new republics, raising theoretical questions such as: How do republican artists and intellectuals respond to the
racial and cultural diversity of their countries? To what extent is the cultural production of postcolonial Spanish America a continuation of colonial cultural forms?
To get to the bottom of some of these issues we will also read those works of postcolonial theory that have proved most thought-provoking for scholars of Latin
American literature. This course fulfills the EDI requirement because our reading of canonical Latin American literature is explicitly focused on issues of power,
272
violence and exclusion, including the historical exclusion of women and indigenous peoples from Latin American literature and politics. Conducted in Spanish.

RLSP 310(S) Narratives of Violence against Women in Contemporary Spain (Same as Women's and Gender Studies 311)
This course focuses on cultural, literary and artistic representations of violence against women in twentieth-century and contemporary Spain. In 2004, Spain
passed the Integral Law of Gendered Violence, which was created to protect victims of domestic violence. However, since the passage of the law, the number of
women killed as a result of domestic violence has remained steadily high. 60 women were killed in 2005, 68 in 2006, 74 in 2007, and 73 in 2008. We will study
how Spanish artists and writers have depicted these shocking realities. Authors read include Camilo Jos Cela, Dulce Chacn, Pablo Picasso, Iciar Bollan and
Alberto Miralles among others.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on class participation, quality of research and two written assignments.

In this seminar we will consider narratives, films and poems from Chile and Argentina from the early nineties until the present. Our focus is therefore the post-dic-
tatorship period, and our aim is to address questions that emerge from types of discourse relevant to this era. How have modernity and consensus influenced
cultural production? How are these related to broader issues such as postmodernism? Can we even relate the discussion of postmodernity to Latin America and its
recent cultural production? We will study the works of writers such as Washington Cucurto, Alan Pauls (Argentina) or Roberto Bolao (Chile). In the poetic
tradition, we will include popular expressions such as hip-hop and punk, in an effort to analyze their creation of a memory of post-dictatorship. In addition we will
study chronicles, comic books, films, blogs and popular music to establish a broader cultural context for our inquiry. Conducted in Spanish.

Professors: CASSIDAY, GOLDSTEIN. Associate Professor: VAN DE STADT. Teaching Associate: ILINA.
LANGUAGE STUDY
The department provides language instruction to enable the student to acquire all four linguistic skills: understanding, speaking, reading, and writing. Russian
101-W88-102 covers the basics of Russian grammar. Russian 151 and 152 offer additional instruction in grammar and provide extensive practice in reading and
conversation.
STUDY ABROAD
The department strongly encourages students desiring to attain fluency in Russian to spend a semester or year studying in Russia or one of the former Soviet
republics. Students generally apply to one of several approved foreign study programs. Russian 152 or the equivalent and junior standing are normally prerequi-
site for study abroad.
LITERATURE AND CULTURE IN TRANSLATION
The department regularly offers courses on Russian literature and culture in English for those students who have little or no knowledge of Russian, but who
wish to become acquainted with the major achievements in Russian literary and cultural history.
THE CERTIFICATE IN RUSSIAN
To enhance a student's educational and professional profiles, the Certificate in Russian offers a useful tool for using the language in a wide variety of disci-
plines. The sequence of language and culture courses is designed to supplement a student's major at Williams by enabling the student to expand his or her
knowledge in a related field.
Students who enter Williams with previous training in Russian may substitute more advanced courses for all the 100-level courses; they can also be exempted
from up to two of the required courses. Thus, in order to earn a certificate a student must take no fewer than five courses (including three courses in Russian) after
enrolling at Williams. Students must receive a minimum grade of B in each course taken in the sequence. In addition, they must receive a score of at least 85% on
a standardized language proficiency test administered by the department.

THE MAJOR
The Russian major offers students an interdisciplinary approach to the intellectual and cultural history of Russia and the former Soviet republics. Students
complete the major by combining courses in Russian language and literature with courses in history, political science, music, economics, and art. The major
requires a minimum of ten courses of which at least six must be conducted in Russian, at least two must be at the 300-level, and one at the 400-level. In addition,
students may take up to four related courses offered by other departments and taught in English.
Examples of appropriate courses in other departments are:
History 140 Fin-de Sicle Russia: Cultural Splendor, Imperial Decay
History 240 Muscovy and the Russian Empire
History 241 The Rise of the Soviet Union
History 440 Reform, Revolution, Terror: Russia, 1900-1939
Sociology 332 Communism and its Aftermath
Students selecting the major must typically complete Russian 152 or the equivalent by the end of the junior year. Majors will normally be expected to take the
400-level seminar offered in their senior year, even if they have previously taken another version of it. Russian majors may receive major credit for summer
language study (in consultation with the department) and for as many as four courses taken during study abroad.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN RUSSIAN
At the beginning of the second semester of the senior year, students may nominate themselves to candidacy for the degree with honors. By the end of the junior
year at the latest, however, they will have established in consultation with the department their qualifications for embarking on the project, the pattern of study to
be followed, and the standards of performance.
Students earn a degree with honors by submitting a senior thesis (493-W31-494) of honors quality.

This course develops all four skills-conversation, listening comprehension, reading, and composition-for students who have completed at least one year of col-
lege-level Russian. Coursework includes a systematic review of Russian grammar, as well as an examination of a variety of materials from Russian and Soviet
culture, current events, and daily life. Intermediate students will concentrate on expanding their vocabulary, while more advanced students will focus on reading
and writing about unabridged texts in Russian. Students who complete the yearlong sequence of RUSS 151 and RUSS 152 should be well prepared to undertake
study abroad in Russia and are encouraged to do so. Each year this course is custom designed to meet the needs of those students who enroll, so that both
intermediate-level and advanced students can benefit from taking RUSS 151 and/or RUSS 152 more than once, which may be done with the permission of the
instructor.
Format: the class meets four hours a week, three with the professor and the fourth with the Russian Teaching Associate (time to be arranged). Requirements:
active class participation, completion of all assignments, quizzes, and a final exam.

RUSS 203(F) Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature in Translation (Same as Comparative Literature 203)
Literature provided the primary medium for political, philosophical, and religious debate in nineteenth-century Russia. It was also one of the major fora through
which Russia could begin to define itself as a nation, tied to, but distinct from, Western Europe. For a long time, Russian authors had relied quite heavily on
foreign literary models for inspiration and direction, and it was only in the early part of the nineteenth century that a clear national tradition could be seen to
emerge. In addition to its task of introducing the century's major authors and their creative ideas, this course will seek to examine the rise of Russian literature as
such, its key movements and their proponents, and the recurring themes of "Russianness" and national identity. Readings by Karamzin, Chaadaev, Pushkin,
Gogol, Goncharov, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov. All readings will be in English.
Requirements: active class participation, two short papers, one oral presentation, and a final research project. No prerequisites.

We are fast approaching the one-hundredth anniversary of Russia's Great October Revolution, a political event that had prodigious cultural consequences and
eventually polarized artists and intellectuals alike. Nowhere is this struggle more prominently played out than in the pages of Russian/Soviet literature. In this
course, we will read a variety of works by "canonical" and "non-canonical" writers and consider the many forces-historical, political, spiritual, ethnic, and cultur-
al-that shaped national belles lettres for the last hundred years. Our authors will include Gorky, Babel, Akhmatova, Bulgakov, Solzhenitsyn, Voznesenkaya, and
Pelevin. No knowledge of Russian is expected and all readings will be in English.
Format: seminar/discussion. Requirements: active and consistent class participation, two short papers, one oral presentation, and a final project.

RUSS 206(S) Topics in Russian Culture: Feasting and Fasting in Russian History
This course will use the methodology of food history to explore the broader historical, economic, and artistic conditions that gave rise to Russian culture. We will
examine culinary practice as well as the social context of cooking and eating in Russia. In order to elucidate the important interplay between culture and cuisine,
we will discuss such issues as the domestic roles of women and serfs, the etiquette of the table, the role of drinking and temperance movements, and the impor-
tance of feasts and fasts in the Russian Orthodox Church calendar. Short stories, memoirs, and cookery books will provide insight into class and gender differ-
ences, cooking techniques, and the specific tastes that characterize Russian cuisine. This class will present Russian culture from a predominantly domestic point
of view that originates from the wooden spoon as much as from the scepter. Knowledge of Russian is not required.
Format: seminar. Requirements: several short written assignments and class presentations, a final project involving research in some aspect of Russian culinary
history, and participation in a communal feast.

RUSS 208(F) Twentieth-Century Russian Art and the Birth of Abstraction (Same as ArtH 266)
Such revolutionary artistic movements as Cubo-Futurism, Suprematism, and Constructivism profoundly influenced the development of twentieth-century art
throughout the Western world-just as the 1917 Russian Revolution upset the world's political balance. This course will investigate Russian art within a cultural
framework and explore the relationship between artistic production and politics. We will begin with a brief overview of important developments in Russian art
that prefigured the twentieth-century artistic revolution: the introduction of icons from Byzantium, the founding of St. Petersburg and the rise of Western-style
portraiture, and the fin-de-sicle movements that united painting with music and ballet. However, the focus of the course will be 1910-1930, when radical innova-
tion was the order of the day and revolutionary ideas sparked entirely new conceptions of art. We will then look at the Socialist Realist style of the Stalin era,
Soviet dissident art and Moscow conceptualism, ending the semester with an exploration of current trends in post-Soviet Russian art.
Format: lecture/discussion. Requirements: active class participation, two 5-8 page papers, and a final 10 page paper or exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 12-15). Preference given to students who can demonstrate an interest in Russian culture.

appropriate historical, social, and philosophical context. For each week of class, students will read a significant portion of a novel by Tolstoy, as well as a selection
of secondary literature taken from those works that inspired the author, reactions that arose at the time of the novel's publication, and scholarship that seeks to
explain the power and enduring significance of these novels. Students will meet with the professor in pairs, with one student writing a five-page paper for each
class session and the other student providing a critique of the paper. For those students without Russian language skills, all works will be read in English transla-
tion. For those students who have completed at least three years of college-level Russian, all primary readings, a significant portion of secondary readings,
discussion, and writing assignments will be completed in Russian.
Format: tutorial. Evaluation will be based on completion of weekly reading and writing assignments and active discussion during tutorial sessions.

RUSS 275 Russian and Soviet Film in Retrospect (Same as Comparative Literature 275) (Not offered 2009-2010)
In this course, we will survey the past one hundred years of Russian and Soviet film to explore how cinema has reflected and, at times, created the country's most
important historical events and cultural myths. We will pay close attention to Russian filmmakers' varied reactions to Hollywood cinema, as well as to the lively
body of cinema theory that these reactions have generated. Our survey will begin in the present day, with key examples of Russian film from the post-Soviet era,
and move backwards through films representative of Glasnost, the Thaw, World War II, Socialist Realism, the October Revolution, and finally, the pre-Revolu-
tionary era. In addition to studying art films by world-famous filmmakers, such as Aleksandr Sokurov, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Sergei Eisenstein, we will watch
popular films that have formed Russians' understanding of their country and themselves.

RUSS 307 Music and Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature (Not offered 2009-2010)
Albeit distinct art forms, music and literature have enjoyed a very fruitful relationship in a number of artistic traditions, and this was particularly true in the rich and
varied cultural life of nineteenth-century Russia. Musicians, composers, or even specific compositions, sometimes became the subject of literary masterpieces.
Other times it was a celebrated work of literature that inspired incidental music, romances, and operas. In this course we will examine the broad and fascinating
relationship between literature and music in short works by Odoevsky, Pushkin, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Kuprin, and Chekhov. We will study the role that music
played in belles lettres as thematic element, cultural commentary, and structuring principle. All primary texts will be read in the original, but some secondary
readings will be in English. Class will be conducted entirely in Russian.

SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor DONALD deB. BEAVER
Advisory Committee: Professors: ALTSCHULER, D. BEAVER, DETHIER, KAPLAN, THOMAN. Associate Professor: MLADENOVIC.
Science and Technology Studies (SCST) is an interdisciplinary program concerned with science and technology and their relationship to society. In addition to
being concerned with the historical development and a philosophical understanding of the ideas and institutions of science and technology; Science and Technol-
ogy Studies also examines their ethical, economic, social, and political implications.
The role that science and technology have played in shaping modern industrial societies is generally acknowledged, but few members of those societies,
including scientists and engineers, possess any understanding of how that process has occurred or much knowledge of the complex technical and social interac-
tions that direct change in either science or society. The Science and Technology Studies Program is intended to help create a coherent course of study for students
interested in these questions by providing a broad range of perspectives. At present, courses are offered which examine the history or philosophy of science and
technology, the sociology and psychology of science, the economics of research and development and technological change, science and public policy, technolo-
gy assessment, technology and the environment, scientometrics, and ethical-value issues.
To complete the requirements of the program, students must complete six courses. The introductory course and senior seminar are required and three elective
courses are chosen from the list of designated electives. Students may choose to concentrate their electives in a single area such as technology, American studies,
philosophy, history of science, economics, environment, current science, or current technology, but are encouraged to take at least one elective in history, history
of science, or philosophy. The sixth course necessary to complete the program is one semester of laboratory or field science in addition to the College's three-
course science requirement. Other science courses of particular interest include Chemistry 110 and Biology 134.
The program is administered by a chair and an advisory committee of faculty who teach in the program. Students who wish to enroll normally register with the
chair by the fall of their junior year.

WILLIAMS PROGRAM IN TEACHING
Director, SUSAN ENGEL
The program in teaching is designed to enable Williams Undergraduates to study the ideas, questions, and practices involved in good teaching at all levels. The
program seeks to promote and facilitate an exchange of ideas about teachers, learners and schools, within and beyond the Williams campus. The program offers a
range of opportunities including courses on education, intensive supervised student teaching, workshops, advising, lecture series, and ongoing peer groups for
those who teach. Students may participate in a variety of ways, ranging from taking one course to a sustained in-depth study of teaching and learning geared to
those who want to become teachers, or educational psychologists. We seek to connect students with one another, to bring in expert teachers to provide mentoring,
and to create links across the curriculum so that students can see the vital connections between what they study (French, Algebra or Biology for instance) and the
process of teaching those topics to elementary and high school students. The program is open to any student interested in education and offers opportunities for all
levels of interest, including those who want to find out about certification and graduate study.
The following provides a sample outline of the sequence of courses and experiences that an interested student might take
z PSYC 101 Intro to Psych (required for further psychology courses);
z PSYC 232 Developmental Psychology and/or
z PSYC 242 Social Psychology;
z PSYC 272 Psychology of Education;
z PSYC 327 Optimizing Learning and Memory
z PSYC 336 Adolescence;
z PSYC 372 Advanced Seminar in Teaching and Learning
z
At least one Winter Study in an intensive teaching practicum. The major programs are in Berkshire County (under PSYC) or in New York City
(under SPEC), although other opportunities may be listed elsewhere in the Winter Study section of the course catalogue.
No specific major is required to participate in the program--although some lend themselves easily to certification, such as Mathematics, English, Biology,
American history, or French, almost all of our majors can provide the basis of teacher certification. Alternately, students can major in Psychology, take a con-
centration of courses in a different field, and then pursue that content area more intensively in graduate work.
Other courses of interest include:

THEATRE (Div. I)
Chair, ROBERT BAKER-WHITE
Professors: BAKER-WHITE, EPPEL. Assistant Professors: SANGARE*, HOLZAPFEL, MORRIS. Lecturers: BROTHERS, CATALANO. Visit-
ing Lecturer: ERICKSON. William Dwight Whitney Professor of Arts and Theatre: BUCKY.
As a reflection of the theatre's historical relationship to literature and the arts, stage production is studied in the context of the literary and artistic movements
which have informed theatrical endeavor. The major in Theatre emphasizes the collaborative nature of the discipline by drawing upon courses offered by faculty
of the Language, Literature, Music, and Art Departments. Although students will be equipped to proceed to graduate and professional schools in theatre, the
major is primarily directed toward those interested in studying the theatre as an artistic phenomenon and as an interpretive tool. Because a deep understanding of
theatre requires training and experience with the synthesis on stage, the major includes curricular study of production and performance, as well as continued
participation in departmental stage production.
Williamstheatre, the production arm of the Department of Theatre, operates under the supervision of the departmental faculty. Major departmental productions
as well as laboratory and experimental productions of all kinds are mounted on the new stages of the '62 Center for Theatre and Dance. Participation in acting or
technical work is open to all members of the Williams College community. Students majoring in Theatre will be asked to consult regularly with departmental
advisors in devising the sequence of courses and production participation that will constitute their major.
MAJOR
The Major in Theatre consists of nine courses.
Six required courses are:
Theatre 104(F) Introduction to World Theatre and Performance
Theatre 103(S) Acting I
Theatre 201 Theatrical Design: The Collaborative Process
Theatre 244 Introduction to Theatre Technology (formerly THEA 102)
Theatre 248 The Modern Theatre: Plays and Performance
Theatre 406 Senior Seminar
Three elective courses must be taken from the department's other offerings. One elective must be a course within the department that culminates in departmen-
tal production. Substitutions of other Williams' courses, or of Study Abroad courses, will be made only with the consent of the department Chair. Students
should consult with the department Chair regularly in planning a balance of practice and scholarship in their elective choices.
Production requirement for the major: All majors in Theatre are required to participate in a minimum of four department productions in addition to the labora-
tory requirement for Theatre 244. Participation in at least two of the four must be in technical production and one of those two must be in stage manage-
ment. Assignment to productions is normally made in consultation with the department Chair.
THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN THEATRE
Candidates for Honors will apply for admission through the submission of a portfolio to the Department Chair by February of their junior year, as well as a
description of their proposed project. The portfolio will be comprised of four parts:
1. The first part will include a list of the courses students have taken relevant to their work towards the major. This list will include courses offered by the
Theatre Department, but may also include classes taken in other Departments. Students should also list and describe relevant independent studies and
production credits.
2. The second part of the portfolio will include a selection of materials developed for these courses and productions listed in Part 1. The selection should
include at least three papers or samples of other written work, and might also include design projects, director's notebooks, studio art projects, actor's
journals or other forms of documentation of the candidate's work. For students who have taken a semester away, it is particularly important that they
provide the Department with a detailed picture of their activities while studying off-campus. Course descriptions and syllabi should be submitted in
addition to a list of courses taken and activities performed.
3. The third part of the portfolio is an annotated bibliography of dramatic texts which the student has read, drawn from a list supplied by the Department.
Annotations should be based upon a particular angle of engagement with the text, that reflects the area or areas that the student has chosen to emphasize in
their theatrical training. For instance, one might choose to write from the point of view of an actor, a designer, a director, a playwright, or a dramaturg.
4. The portfolio should conclude with a retrospective essay that reflects on the materials that are being submitted. Students should look for connections
between the various aspects of their work, state any theoretical positions that they have come to embrace, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and
discuss their educational goals for their work with the Department during their Senior year.
The portfolio will be examined alongside the student's record and his or her project description; a determination will then be made as to admission into the
Honors program. Students intending to apply for Honors should meet with the Department Chair by the end of the fall semester of their junior year. Once a student
is admitted to the Honors program, the department Chair will assign an Honors Project Advisor, who will work with the student to specify a timeline and work
program for the completion of the Honors Project. At a minimum, this will entail enrollment in Theatre 493 or 494, plus W32, plus one other course offered either
within the department or elsewhere that the candidate and thesis advisor designate as contributing specifically to the overall goals of the honors work. This honors
elective may not fulfill any other portion of the Theatre Major, or any other major the student may be pursuing. All honors candidates will present their completed
projects to the Department Honors Committee for evaluation.
STUDY ABROAD
The Theatre Department attempts to work individually with majors and prospective majors who desire to study abroad. In general, with careful planning it is
usually quite easy for students to complete the major in Theatre if they study abroad for one semester of their junior year. For those wishing to study abroad for
more than one semester of junior year, a more complicated situation may arise, but one that can often be successfully managed through close consultation with the
department chair. Students are encouraged to consult with the chair early in their Williams careers if they anticipate a combination of Theatre major and study
abroad.
THEA 103(S) Acting I
This course deals with the development of intellectual and emotional resources required for the actor and will explore an acting technique based on the work of
Russian actor and director Constantin Stanislavsky. Students will examine the power of public presence through theory and practice while expanding their talents,
sensitivity, and imagination.
Format: studio. Evaluation will be based on committed participation in class, preparation and performance of assigned material, and some modest written assign-
ments.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 14. Preference given to first-year students or sophomores considering the Theatre major.
This course is a prerequisite for Theatre 204.

THEA 104(F) Introduction to World Theatre and Performance (Same as Comparative Literature 104) (D)
This introductory survey course will explore a selection of dramatic and performance traditions from around the globe, focusing on the foundations of theatre:
audience, actor, playwright, director, designer, and producer. Organized geographically, the course will approach select theatre traditions from around the globe
and provide a basis for further study of modern theatre and performance. Specific topics addressed may include: West African masquerade, Greek and Roman
drama, Medieval and Renaissance English theatre, French comedy and melodrama, Japanese Noh and Kabuki theatre, Indian Sanskrit drama, and American
popular entertainment. Some interpretive methods will also be considered when relevant, such as gender, sexuality, and postcolonial theory. Films and other
visual media will be included to enhance our understanding of how theatre is made and for what purposes. This course meets the criteria of the Exploring Diversi-
ty Initiative as it both engages in a cross-cultural investigation of performance and explores how theatre is deeply embedded in political power relations.
Format: lecture/seminar. Evaluation: mid-term and final exam; one 5-page paper; in-class writing and discussion.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limited to 40, split into two sections of 20. This course is a requirement for and is suggested as an introduction to the major in
Theatre. All students enrolled in the course are required to attend the fall departmental theatre production.

THEA 201(S) Theatrical Design: Process of Collaboration
This course examines the designer's creative process and collaborative role in the creation of theater. Over a series of practical projects in scenic, costume, and
lighting design we will try different techniques for eliciting an initial creative response to a text, developing that response into a point-of-view, and solving the
practical needs of the production. A particular emphasis will be placed on how design elements synthesize with one another, with the work of the actors and
director, and with the larger intellectual, emotional, and physical context of the production as a whole. Basic presentation skills and technique, as well as method-
ologies for critical feedback, will be taught as crucial elements of design development. Lab fee: $125.
279
Format: studio. Evaluation will be based upon committed class participation and thoughtful, timely completion of all assignments and projects.
No prerequisites. This course is a prerequisite for all upper-level design courses. Enrollment: 12 (expected: 10). If overenrolled, preference to Theatre majors.
Hour: 11:00-12:15 MWF Lab: 1:10-3:50 W MORRIS
THEA 204(F) Acting II
Students will continue to develop technical skills, and the emotional and intellectual resources, required for the actor. The focus will be on the issue of character-
ization strongly based on the foundational works of Stanislavski. The means of study and experimentation will be intense scene work requiring thorough prepara-
tion and beneficial collaboration. Improvisation and other exercises will be used to complement the textual work. The dramatic texts providing scenes for class
will be exclusively from the early realist works onward.
Although there will be some modest written assignments, evaluation in the course will principally reflect the degree of committed participation in the preparation
and performance of production exercises.
Format: studio. Prerequisite: Theatre 103 or permission of the instructor, and sophomore standing. Enrollment limit: 14 (expected: 14). Preference to students
intending to major in Theatre.
Hour: 1:10-3:50 MR BUCKY
THEA 205 The Culture of Carnival (Not offered 2009-2010; to be offered 2010-2011)
Carnival is a regenerative festival as well as a transgressive one. It is a time for upheavals and recreating for one day, a new world order. Men dress as women,
women dress as men, the poor become kings; drink and sex and outrageous behavior is sanctioned. We will look at festivals in such places as New Orleans,
Venice, and Rio. Central to this course are the cultural and religious lives of these societies, and how these festivals exist politically in a modern world as theatre
and adult play. A variety of sources will be used, such as newspaper accounts, films, photography, personal memoirs and essays on the subject.
Students will be evaluated on regular active class participation, one oral presentation, one 5-page essay and one 15-page research paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference will be given to sophomores and first-year students.

THEA 214(S) Playwriting (Same as English 214) (W)
A studio course designed for those interested in writing and creating works for the theatre. The course will include a study of playwriting in various styles and
genres, a series of set exercises involving structure and the use of dialogue, as well as individual projects. We will read and we will write, beginning with small
exercises and working toward a longer final project. Students will be expected to share in each other's work on a weekly basis, and to collaborate with students
enrolled in Directing. At the end of the term, we will share our collaborative work with the community as part of a One-Act Playwriting Festival.

THEA 215 Reading Contemporary Drama, or Turn of This Century Drama (Same as Comparative Literature 215) (Not offered 2009-2010)
The medium of theatre is both ancient and, paradoxically, perhaps our most fluid and immediate. What do our plays say about our world today? Join a working
playwright in reading the new plays she finds most vital and exciting, including the work of Caryl Churchill, Suzan-Lori Parks, Tom Stoppard, and Paula Vogel,
as well as brand new voices, including plays so new they're not yet published.
Format: seminar. Evaluation: Students will be expected to respond to these plays both in written assignments and in-class discussions.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limited: 15 (expected: 10). Preference given to Theatre majors.
THEA 228 Theatrical Self-Production (Not offered 2009-2010)
In today's theater world, self-production can be a vital, engaging, and necessary method of creating and producing theatrical works. This course examines theatri-
cal self-production and the ways in which artists exploit this model in pursuit of their individual and collective ambitions. Through a careful examination of
successes and failures in contemporary theatrical collectives, this class will form its own unique structure for developing and producing a range of new, innova-
tive, and thematically linked artistic work. Operating within carefully chosen constraints, students will share equally the administrative, artistic, and production
roles in the public presentation of their works. Thus, a major emphasis of the course will be on experiential education, which provides an invaluable opportunity to
encounter firsthand the highly complex relationship between artistry and production. An important component of the class will be ongoing symposium with
practitioners from the profession, as well as the Department of Theater, that will focus on a range of specifically targeted skill sets necessary for students to realize
their goals. Systematic group presentations of the creative development process will provide opportunities for guidance, critique, and sustained mentorship.
Format: seminar. Evaluation: Students will complete a comprehensive self-evaluation as a final project. Grading will be based on committed class participation,
contribution to the collective work of the class, group and individual presentations, and self-evaluation. Students from a broad range of curricular disciplines are
welcome.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limited: 20 (expected: 15). First-year students may be accepted with approval of instructor. Upon overenrollment, the instructors
will seek to balance the course by level of prior theatrical experience.

THEA 236 Political Theatre Making (Not offered 2009-2010)
Placing twentieth-century theatricality in the context of its historical roots in Western theatre, this course will examine a broad range of types of protest move-
ments. From the biting observations of the British class system by playwrights such as Oscar Wilde, Noel Coward, and John Osborne, to mid-century American
political writers such as Clifford Odets and Edward Albee, and Italy's Dario Fo, to the relentless satire of contemporary South African performers such as Pieter
Dirk-Uys, we will investigate dramatic writing and performance style as aspects of social and political resistance. Other groups studied may include the protest
theatre of Johannesburg's Market Theatre, Luiz Valdez's Teatro Campesino, and a younger generation of post-apartheid experimentation in multi-ethnic South
African theatre.

THEA 241(F) Performing Race: From Shakespeare to Spike Lee (Same as Africana Studies 241 and Comparative Literature 241) (D)
Since theatre is both a visual and a verbal medium, the goal is to explore, through detailed close analysis, visual and verbal representations of race--with repre-
sentation being understood to mean cultural construction and with race being defined to include whiteness as a racial category. The comprehensive scope is
deliberately cross-historical to create a longer historical timeline that expands the range for comparative perspectives in the study of race. The Renaissance start-
ing point calls attention to the complex operations of blackface performance in which black roles in Shakespeare and Jonson are played by white actors who are
blacked up. We evaluate how this mode of white actors literally re-presenting black characters affects the range of meaning for images of blackness. Asymmetries
of power, and the potential for disrupting differential power, are considered in relations between blacks and whites not only at the level of characters but also at the
level of authorship. We examine what happens when a black writer gains control of the means of representation, with critical revisions of Othello as a case in
point. Contemporary works include plays by Djanet Sears, Derek Walcott, Lorraine Hansberry, James Baldwin, Anna Deavere Smith, Suzan Lori-Parks, and
August Wilson, as well as Spike Lee's film Bamboozled. This is an Exploring Diversity Initiative (EDI) course because, in the context of racial difference, we will
confront forthrightly the negative realities and critically assess the possibilities for productive change and hope in cross-racial interactions.
Format: discussion. Evaluation based on active participation in class discussion, short papers, final exam.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected: 12). Preference given to Theatre majors.

THEA 243T Strategies of Political Theatre (Not offered 2009-2010) (W)
"Change the world; it needs it," is the German playwright Bertolt Brecht's famous clarion cry. In this tutorial, we will take a critical look at the strategies employed
in the twentieth century by several dramatists who have attempted to heed Brecht's exhortation. After a brief glance at Aristophanes and Shakespeare to correct
any possible mistaken impression that political theatre is a twentieth-century invention, the class will proceed, of course, to the plays and essays of Brecht himself
(and his predecessor Erwin Piscator). Students will read Brecht's Mother Courage on war; The Measures Taken on political morality; Peter Weiss' Marat/ Sade
on revolution and The Investigation on the Holocaust; Marc Blitzstein's The Cradle Will Rock on corruption and corporate greed; Arthur Miller's The Crucible on
280
modern "witchhunts;" Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party, Mountain Language, The New World Order, and One for the Road on torture; Athol Fugard's State-
ments After an Arrest Under the Immorality Act on Apartheid; Barbara Garson's MacBird on Vietnam; Caryl Churchill's Cloud Nine on gender and sexuality; and
Anna Deavere Smith's Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992 on race in America. With these plays and associated essays, the tutorial will focus on a critical appraisal of the
works in their dramatic design, as artful political commentary, and as calls to political action.
Format: tutorial. Requirements: In the first two weeks of the tutorial the class will meet together as a group to establish its bearings. Thereafter students will meet
in pairs once a week. Each student will write a 4- to 6-page paper every other week, and be prepared to mount a detailed comment/response in the alternate weeks.
The focus will be both on interpretative skills in reading dramatic texts, and on the ability to construct critical arguments and respond to them. A final project that
can take the form of a performance piece, a playtext, or a paper on a major American performance ensemble devoted to political drama is required.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10 (expected 10). Open to sophomores and upperclassmen.

This tutorial course will consider the understudied role of women in western theatre--as active subjects, spectators, and authors --focusing on gender identity,
sexuality, performativity, and representations of the body on stage and within drama. While the focus of the tutorial will be directed towards the modern period,
we will begin by studying the role of women on the English Restoration stage and consider the increasing presence of women as audience members, playwrights,
and performers throughout the nineteenth century. Within the modern period, close analysis of plays by Sophie Treadwell, Gertrude Stein, Lillian Hellman,
Lorraine Hansberry, Maria Irene Fornes, Caryl Churchill, Adrienne Kennedy, Holly Hughes (WOW Cafe), Wendy Wasserstein, Naomi Iizuka, Suzan-Lori
Parks, Eve Ensler, Sarah Kane, Sarah Ruhl, and others, will accompany readings of select gender and performance theory. Attention will be given to the diversity
of race and class represented by the women subjects of our study. This tutorial is intended for sophomores and above.

THEA 338(S) Facing the Music
Music has accompanied theatrical performance since the birth of drama. Over time music on stage has served many dramatic functions: sometimes it merely
serves to embellish the emotive temperature but, more consequentially, music can also constitute the major source of dramatic articulation. In this course we will
study the specific dramatic function of music in such works as Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte, Wagner's Die Meistersinger, Verdi's Otello, Brecht's Mahagonny and
The Measures Taken, (music by Weill and Eisler), Sondheim's Company and Sweeney Todd, and Glass and Wilson's postmodern opera Einstein on the Beach.
The course will also study the variety of working relationships that musicians have enjoyed with their collaborators in theatrical production.
Format: discussion/seminar. Requirements: Energetic and committed participation is required. Written exercises will include a midterm report on the role of
music in a live performance, and a final paper on a dramatic work to be chosen in consultation with the instructor.

THEA 339 Introduction to Dramaturgy: The Art of Classical Adaptation (Not offered 2009-2010)
The dramaturg is an important collaborator in the theatrical production process, playing the multi-faceted role of historian, cultural critic, audience educator, and
overall supporter of the production team. Working closely with the director, the dramaturg helps to shape a production and facilitate the demanding process of
creating a world on stage. This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of production dramaturgy, applying our study of the practice to the topic of
classical adaptation and translation. Sophocles' Antigone and Euripides' Hippolytus will serve as two of our foundational texts, from which we'll consider adapta-
tions by Racine, Anouilh, Brecht, Gambaro, and LeCompte. We'll also view how modern directors have interpreted the classics through unique productions, such
as Breuer's The Gospel at Colonus, Brook's Mahabharata, Mnouchkine's Les Atrides, and Ninagawa's Medea.
Format: seminar. Requirements/Method of evaluation: Assignments will be project-based and will range from making image boards to writing program notes. As
a final assignment, students will research and write their own mini-adaptations of classical works and present their material to one another through informal,
staged readings.
Prerequisites: This course will serve as the Junior Seminar for majors in the Department of Theatre. Enrollment for non-majors is possible with permission of

This seminar course is required of all senior Theatre majors. The course is a revolving topics seminar. The subject matter and reading list for each iteration of the
course will be determined by the instructor, but will in each instance focus on a current or historical question of theatre theory and practice. It is understood that the
subjects addressed in the course will be broad enough to engage the varied interests of each senior class. The specific requirements for the class may vary, but in
all cases students will be required to present original research and analysis in a public seminar presentation at the end of the semester. In Fall 2009 the seminar will
explore the interrelated cultural phenomena of theatre (or, more broadly, performance), ritual and play. Each of these nouns may be considered as necessary
attribute of any human activity, as a means of communication between or among people, as a subject or field of scientific inquiry, or as a facet of artistic cultural
production. The purpose of the seminar will be to explore each of these phenomena on their own terms, and then to investigate some of the ways in which they
interconnect in the spheres of art, religion, popular culture, and everyday life. Readings will include theorists from literary studies, anthropology, cultural studies,
and related fields, as well as primary texts from drama and other arts.
Format: seminar. Requirements: project work, and presentation of original research and analysis in a public setting at the end of the semester.

WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES (Div. II)
Chair, Professor LUCIE SCHMIDT
Advisory Committee: Professors: BUELL, BUNDTZEN**, DRUXES, C. JOHNSON*, SAWICKI. Associate Professors: KENT, SCHMIDT,
SOLUM. Visiting Associate Professors: HONDERICH. Assistant Professors: DUBOW, HOLZAPFEL, MARASCO*, MARTIN. Librarian:
OHM. Director of the Academic Resource Center: FOSTER. Health Educator: DONNA DENELLI-HESS.
Women's and Gender Studies can be defined as the study of how gender is constructed, how it is inflected by differences of race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and
so on, how gender affects the experiences and situations of men and women, and how assumptions about gender influence the construction of knowledge and
experience. Scholarship in Women's and Gender Studies has brought neglected material into established fields and raised important methodological questions
that cross disciplinary boundaries and challenge established intellectual frameworks. The program in Women's and Gender Studies thus includes courses from a
wide variety of disciplines that focus in a coherent way on gender issues, as well as core courses that acquaint students with the interdisciplinarity of the field.
THE MAJOR
The Women's and Gender Studies major encourages exposure to the interdisciplinary character of feminist scholarship. In addition, majors are required to gain
some knowledge of methods within a field or discipline (3 courses in one of the categories listed below), to appreciate the importance of diversity (racial, sexual,
class, ethnic, national, etc.) in scholarship on gender, to gain exposure to feminist theory, and to pursue work at an advanced level (3 courses at the 300-level).
In order to ensure that students reflect about the paths that they choose through the major, each major will be assigned to an advisor in the spring of the
sophomore year. With the advisor, the student will establish a revisable course of study for the following two years. Students interested in declaring a major should
contact the chair of the Program (Schmidt, x3143).
Required Courses
The major consists of at least 9 courses. The following are required:
WGST 101 Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies
WGST 402 Junior/Senior Seminar in Women's and Gender Studies (The seminar explores topics in Women's and Gender Studies, and varies from year to
year. Majors may take more than one seminar, space permitting.)
Students can check with the program chair to see if other courses not listed here might count as electives.

THE DEGREE WITH HONORS IN WOMEN'S AND GENDER STUDIES
Honors in Women's and Gender Studies may be granted to majors after an approved candidate completes an honors project, delivers a public presentation of
the work, and is awarded honors by the Women's and Gender Studies Committee.
The honors project may be fall semester (plus winter study) or a year-long project. It may consist of a conventional research thesis of 40-70 pages or of other
modes of presentation (e.g., art, music, poetry, theater, fiction). Proposals for non-thesis projects should include evidence of experience and competence in the
chosen mode.
A student may become a candidate for honors in Women's and Gender Studies after the following criteria are met:
1). in April of the junior year, submission and Women's and Gender Studies Committee approval of a 4- to 6-page project proposal, in which the ideas, aim,
general methodology, and preliminary bibliography for the project are outlined and a faculty advisor is named; prior to submission of this proposal, stu-
dents must consult with a reference librarian.
2). at the end of the junior year, cumulative grade point average of 3.5 from courses taken in the major;
283
3). in the first week of classes of the senior year, submission and approval by the faculty advisor and second reader of a 5- to 10-page "Plan of Action" (an
overview of what has already been completed and a schedule of what needs to be accomplished to finish the project). Where appropriate, students pursuing
honors will continue to consult with the second reader over the course of the semester(s).
All honors work, including the public presentation, will be evaluated by the Women's and Gender Studies Committee. It will decide on the awarding of honors;
the advisor will award the grade(s)
STUDY ABROAD
The Williams College Women's and Gender Studies Program encourages potential majors to study abroad in order to enhance their education and gain inter-
national perspectives on gender and women's issues and feminism. There are many excellent study abroad opportunities offering students a variety of possible
experiences: among them cultural immersion, field work, intensive language learning, independent study, participation in another educational system. There are
several semester-long programs with a specific focus on women and/or gender administered by other U.S. Colleges that would especially enrich the educational
experience of our majors:
Antioch College: Comparative Women's Studies in Europe fall semester
Augsburg College, Center for Global Education: Crossing Borders: Gender and Social Change in Mesoamerica fall semester; and Social and Environmental
Justice in Latin America spring semester
School for International Training:
The Balkans: Women and Democratization, fall or spring semester
Jamaica: Gender and Development, fall or spring semester
Mali: Gender and Development, fall or spring semester
The Netherlands: Identity, Gender and Sexuality, fall or spring semester
CROSS-LISTED COURSES (INCLUDING SEQUENCE COURSES)
WGST 101(F,S) Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies (W) (D)
This discussion course introduces a range of feminist issues, theories, and controversies. It has several aims: to provide critical and analytical tools for thinking
about gender; to explore key issues confronting women in U.S. (and other) societies, and to discuss strategies for confronting them. The course will examine
issues such as: body politics, sexuality, reproductive rights, sexual violence, gender and work, motherhood and family. Above all, the course is intended as an
exploration of the tremendous diversity of thought contained under the general rubrics of feminist and gender studies and as a vehicle for developing skills in
writing and research, as well as analytical tools for further work in the field. This course meets the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative in that its
main emphases are on challenging the notion of one universalizing category of "woman," and to recognize the diverse ways in which national, sexual, ethnic,
racial, classed and other kinds of differences produce multiple and often divergent relations of gendered power. It also whenever possible contextualizes within a
global frame the central issues that have made up and continue to define the U.S. feminist tradition, in order to encourage students to recognize the role cultural
difference plays in a variety of feminist issues and to decenter the U.S as a reference point for all feminist theory and politics.
Format: seminar. Requirements: regular short essays, class presentations, and a longer paper, with revisions. Evaluation will be based on these assignments and
class participation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 19 per section (expected: 19 per section).

This course will offer an introduction to the burgeoning interdisciplinary field of gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender/queer studies, in part through examining histor-
ical, legal, literary, filmic, cultural studies, sociological, and popular texts, as well as work done under the umbrella of queer theory. Subjects covered may include
the following: histories of sexualities in the U.S., feminism and its relation to queer studies; how sexuality is racialized; transgender and intersex theory and
activism; globalization and sexuality; and strategies of resistance and visibility such as those evidenced by AIDS activism/theory and debates over gay marriage.
An essential part of the course will be exploring how race, class, religion, and nationality contribute to the construction and lived experience of modern gender and
sexual identities. Readings may include works by Foucault, Sedgwick, Riggs, Halley, Warner, Berlant, Chauncey, Chee, Feinberg, Manalaslan, Crimp, Lorde,
McBride, and Massad. This class meets the requirements of the Exploring Diversity Initiative in that it emphasizes empathetic understanding of gender and
sexual diversity; studying relations of power and privilege as they apply to sexual, gender, racial, class and national identities and practices; and foregrounds
critical theorization of gender and sexuality.
Format: discussion. Requirements: active participation in discussion, critical responses, 3 short papers (3-5 pages), final paper (9-11 pages).

WGST 212(S) Ethics and Reproductive Technologies (Same as Philosophy 212) (W)
In her groundbreaking book, The Tentative Pregnancy, Barbara Katz Rothman writes that "[t]he technological revolution in reproduction is forcing us to confront
the very meaning of motherhood, to examine the nature and origins of the mother-child bond, and to replace--or to let us think we can replace--chance with
choice." Taking this as our starting point, in this course we will examine a number of conceptual and ethical issues in the use and development of technologies
related to human reproduction, drawing out their implications for such core concepts as "motherhood" and "parenthood," family and genetic relatedness, ex-
ploitation and commodification, and reproductive rights and society's interests in reproductive activities. Topics will range from consideration of "mundane"
technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), prenatal genetic screening and testing, and surrogacy, to the more extraordinary, including pre-implantation diag-
nosis (PID), post-menopausal reproduction, post-mortem gamete procurement, reproductive cloning and embryo splitting, and in utero medical interventions.
Background readings include sources rooted in traditional modes of bioethical analysis as well as those incorporating feminist approaches.
Format: discussion. Requirements: active participation in class discussions, four to five short reflection papers, and two longer papers ( 5-10 pages).
No prerequisites; but introductory-level course in Philosophy and/or Women's and Gender Studies highly recommended. Enrollment limit: 19 (expected: 19).

WGST 402(S) Transformations and Entanglements: Identity and Agency
How are we human? What does it mean to speak about the "self"? How ought we to live? In this seminar we shall explore and evaluate contributions by feminists
as well as gender and sexuality scholars, activists, and artists to questions about agency, identity, difference, power, relationality and responsibility. We shall
emphasize some of the current interdisciplinary positions being forged and the different media through which these issues are being elaborated and lived.
Throughout the course, we shall ask how identity, agency, and ethics are enacted and revealed in and through practices and ideas about change and difference (or
lack of difference).
Format: seminar. Requirements: attendance and active, informed participation in all sessions; reading journal; one 2-page paper; two 5- to 7-page seminar papers;

CRITICAL REASONING AND
ANALYTICAL SKILLS (CRAAS) COURSES
To one degree or another, every class at Williams goes beyond its subject--be it mathematics, Machiavelli, or modernism--to teach intellectual skills that
have wide application in other fields as well as outside of the academy: scientific reckoning, expository writing, rhetorical analysis, oral presentation, and so on.
Courses offered under the CRAAS initiative foreground such analytical skills. While each CRAAS class covers a different topic, all are aimed particularly at
developing the processes necessary for excellence in a range of fields: techniques for analyzing ideas, data, texts or artworks; approaches to interpreting, synthe-
sizing, and developing arguments; strategies for presenting ideas and results.
CRAAS classes typically emphasize the practices of meta-analysis--self-criticism, editing, and revision--with the goal of constant improvement. Many
classes feature peer tutoring, small group work, and intensive one-on-one engagement with the professor. Students should leave a CRAAS course with a substan-
tially heightened ability to approach problems, analyze texts, and craft arguments in whatever discipline they may go on to explore.
A few CRAAS courses are restricted to advanced students, but the majority are open to all, and some are specifically targeted for first year students. Most have
strictly limited enrollment. Because these classes cultivate the general strategies of effective scholarship, students are encouraged to consider taking a CRAAS
course early in their academic careers.

EXPLORING DIVERSITY INITIATIVE
Williams College is committed to creating and maintaining a curriculum, faculty, and student body that reflects and explores a diverse, globalized world and
the multi-cultural character of the United States. Courses designated "(D)" in the College Bulletin are a part of the College's Exploring Diversity Initiative (EDI);
they represent our dedication to study groups, cultures, and societies as they interact with, and challenge, each other. Through such courses, Williams College
students and faculty also consider the multiple approaches that engage these issues. Rather than simply focus on the study of specific peoples, cultures, or regions
of the world, in the past or present, however, courses fulfilling the EDI requirement actively promote a self-conscious and critical engagement with diversity. They
urge students to consider the operations of difference in the world and provide them with the tools to do so. The ultimate aim of the EDI requirement is to lay the
groundwork for a life-long engagement with the diverse cultures, societies, and histories of the United States and the rest of the world.

QUANTITATIVE/FORMAL REASONING COURSES
Williams students should be adept at reasoning mathematically and abstractly. The ability to apply a formal method to reach conclusions, to use numbers
comfortably, and to employ the research tools necessary to analyze data lessen barriers to carrying out professional and economic roles. Prior to their senior year,
all students must satisfactorily complete a Quantitative/Formal Reasoning (QFR) course--those marked with a "(Q)." Students requiring extra assistance (as
assessed during First Days) are normally placed into Mathematics 100/101/102, which is to be taken before fulfilling the QFR requirement.
The hallmarks of a QFR course are the representation of facts in a language of mathematical symbols and the use of formal rules to obtain a determinate
answer. Primary evaluation in these courses is based on multistep mathematical, statistical, or logical inference (as opposed to descriptive answers).

WRITING-INTENSIVE COURSES
Courses designated as "writing intensive"--those marked with a "(W)"--stress the process of learning to write effectively. Such courses include a substantial
amount of writing (a minimum of 20 pages), usually divided into several discrete assignments. Instructors pay close attention to matters of style and argumenta-
tion. Enrollments are limited to 19.
All Williams College students are required to take two writing-intensive courses: one by the end of the sophomore year and one by the end of the junior year.
Students will benefit most from writing-intensive courses by taking them early in their college careers and are therefore strongly encouraged to complete the
requirement by the end of the sophomore year.
Courses that may be used to meet the requirement in 2008-2009:

WILLIAMS-EXETER PROGRAMME AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY
Director, Professor THOMAS A. KOHUT
THE PROGRAMME
Williams College offers a year-long program of studies at Oxford University in co-operation with Exeter College (founded in 1314), one of the constituent
colleges of the University. Williams students will be enrolled as Visiting Students at Exeter and as such will be undergraduate members of the University, eligible
for access to virtually all of its facilities, libraries, and resources. As Visiting Students in Oxford, students admitted to the Programme will be fully integrated into
the intellectual and social life of one of the world's great universities.
Although students on the Programme will be members of Exeter College, entitled to make full use of Exeter facilities (including the College Library), dine
regularly in Hall, and join all College clubs and organizations on the same terms as other undergraduates at Exeter, students will reside in Ephraim Williams
House, a compound of four buildings owned by Williams College, roughly 1.4 miles north of the city centre. Six students from Exeter College will normally
reside in Ephraim Williams House each year, responsible for helping to integrate Williams students into the life of the College and the University. A resident
director (and member of the Williams faculty) administers Ephraim Williams House, oversees the academic program, and serves as both the primary academic
and personal advisor to Williams students in Oxford.
Students on the Williams-Exeter Programme are required to be in residence in Oxford from Thursday, 1 October 2009, until 26 June 2010 with two breaks for
vacations between the three terms. Students enroll for the full academic year, which consists of three eight-week terms of instruction: MICHAELMAS TERM
(11 October to 5 December 2009), HILARY TERM (17 January to 13 March 2010), and TRINITY TERM (25 April to 19 June 2010). Students are expected to
be in residence to write their first tutorial papers in the week (0th Week) before the eight weeks of instruction begin and to remain in residence during the week
(9th Week) after the term ends in order to sit final examinations. Between the three terms there are two intervening five week vacations, during which students
may be expected to continue reading as preparation for their upcoming tutorials. Students are required to arrive in Oxford by 1 October 2009 for the ten-day
orientation.
THE TUTORIAL SYSTEM
Undergraduate instruction at Oxford University is largely carried out through individual or small-group tutorials, in which students meet weekly with their
tutor to present and discuss an essay they have written, based on an extensive amount of reading undertaken from an assigned reading list they will receive at the
beginning of each term. In addition to the weekly tutorial, students are usually expected to attend a course of lectures offered by the University that corresponds to
the material being addressed in their tutorials.
Each student will plan a course of study for the three terms of the academic year in consultation with the director of the Programme. In his or her capacity as the
Tutor for Visiting Students at Exeter College, the director, working closely with Exeter's subject tutors, will arrange the teaching for the students, monitor student
progress, be in regular contact with the student's tutors, supervise the examinations that students sit at the end of each academic term, and report on each student's
academic progress to the Senior Tutor at Exeter College. There are no "add/drop" periods at Oxford; once a student has made a commitment to a particular tutorial
course, and the director has then secured a tutor to teach that course, students cannot back out or change the terms of the tutorial. All tutorials at Oxford are graded,
although in exceptional circumstances a tutorial may be converted to pass/fail before the end of the fourth week of term with the permission of the Programme
director.
Over the course of the three terms, students are required to enroll in a minimum of FIVE tutorial courses (each consisting of eight individual tutorial meetings
and generally requiring the preparation of eight essays). It is possible for students, in consultation with their tutor, to spread an eight-session tutorial out over two
terms, however. Although most students take the minimum five tutorial courses, many have enrolled in two tutorials per term for a total of six tutorials over their
time at Oxford.
GRADES AND CREDIT
Grades for each tutorial course reflect the grade assigned to all eight tutorial sessions, including their related essays, considered together, as well as the grade for
the final examination. Final examinations last three hours and are always sat in the ninth week of term, following the eight weeks of instruction. For some tutorial
courses, tutors may elect to offer the student the option of a final paper or project in lieu of an examination.
Upon satisfactory completion of the requirements for the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford University, students receive academic credit for a regular
Williams academic year, with each eight-session tutorial plus final examination counting as the equivalent of two regular semester courses taken at Williams.
Grades eventually become a part of their Williams transcript and will be included in the computation of their Grade Point Average.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may be used toward fulfilling the divisional distribution requirement; a student may earn a maximum of three distribution require-
ments, with no more than one from each division, for the year. All tutorial courses at Oxford meet the Williams College "Writing Intensive" designation, except
for those in the studio arts, mathematics, and the sciences.
Tutorial courses in Oxford may also be used to meet major requirements. Some departments at Williams will grant a two-course credit towards the major for
each tutorial course taken at Oxford. Most departments, however, will grant a one-course credit towards the major for each relevant tutorial course taken at
Oxford. Students are encouraged to check with their department chair(s) to confirm official department policy.
THE COURSE OF STUDY
In addition to the opportunity to pursue British and Commonwealth Studies, Williams students in Oxford will be able to pursue tutorials in fields in which
Oxford is particularly noted (Economics, English Literature, Modern History, Philosophy, Politics, Classics, Theology, the Natural Sciences, etc.). Exeter College
also has fellows in English Language and Literature (with interests ranging from the Renaissance-including Shakespeare-to the early nineteenth century), in
Politics (with interests in international relations and comparative politics), and in History (with an interest in the medieval period) committed to teaching Williams
students, and students are thus encouraged to consider undertaking at least one tutorial course in these fields as part of their course of study.
What follows is a PARTIAL list of tutorial courses normally available to students studying on the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford. The tutorials listed
below represent a selection of some of the standard "papers" (courses) that comprise the Oxford degrees in various subjects and that are taught in tutorial format,
although most are not offered every Oxford term. It needs to be emphasized that this is only a partial list, that the tutorial offerings at Oxford University are
incredibly rich, and that one of the attractions of the Programme is that it enables students to define, develop, and pursue their academic interests. Students are
therefore encouraged to explore all the courses offered at Oxford even if they are not listed in this Catalog.
Tutorial courses are not offered every term and are often accompanied by scheduled lectures. Although the term in which the lectures are delivered is some-
times listed below, as is the term in which students should take the tutorials (MT-Michaelmas Term; HT-Hilary Term; TT-Trinity Term), these change from year to
year. It is therefore imperative that students consult the relevant "faculty" webpages to make sure when the lectures and/or tutorials they wish to take are actually
offered. Sometimes, where appropriate, prerequisites are also listed.
A full summary of the list of courses offered by subject can be found at: http://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate_courses/courses/index.html.
Although some courses descriptions are provided below, detailed descriptions of all the courses listed in this catalog can be found on the websites of respective
departments or faculties the links of which can be found at: http://www.ox.ac.uk/divisions/department_az.html.

NON-CREDIT FOREIGN LANGUAGE STUDY
In addition to their regular tutorial courses, students may begin or continue the study of a wide range of foreign languages on a non-credit basis through a
variety of arrangements available through the University as well as a number of other educational and cultural institutions in the city of Oxford. The Programme
normally subsidizes such study.
STUDENT LIFE
By virtue of the fact that, while in Oxford, they are officially Visiting Students at the University-and full members of Exeter College-Williams students are
offered every opportunity to become fully integrated into student life in Oxford. Both Exeter College and Oxford University are home to an exceptional variety of
sports clubs, debating societies, interest groups, cultural organizations, and social activities, virtually all of which are available to Visiting Student members of the
University. Students are encouraged to participate fully in the social life of Exeter College-to dine in Hall as often as they wish, to frequent the College bar, to use
the College's athletic facilities, and to become members of the various College clubs and organizations. Furthermore, Williams students also have access to the
University's athletic events, concerts, theatrical productions, museums, and libraries. All Williams students in Oxford are encouraged to join the Oxford Union,
which, in addition to its debating activities and club rooms, possesses dining facilities and the largest lending library in the University.
At the Ephraim Williams House, all Williams students are housed in large double rooms and enjoy full access to the House's library, common rooms, laundry
facilities, computer lab, and a large dining room, in which a weekly catered meal is served during the eight weeks of term. There are also a number of small
kitchens in the House which students may use. All rooms are fully wired for high-speed internet access and are fully equipped with furnishings, bed linens, and a
telephone. The grounds include a courtyard, sheltered bike racks, barbecue facilities, and gardens. A number of student jobs are available during the academic
year for students who wish to earn a little spending money by helping to maintain the facilities and organize Programme activities. Ephraim Williams House is a
short bike or bus ride (or a twenty-minute walk) from Exeter College and the center of town, and is within easy walking distance of the University parks and the
local shops, restaurants and banks of Summertown. The Programme will partially subsidize student bus passes to facilitate travel around Oxford.
Before the academic year begins-on Thursday, 1 October 2009-ten days of orientation activities are scheduled. Students are expected to be in residence for all
of these many activities, some of which take place in Ephraim Williams House, others at Exeter College. At this time students will become acquainted with the
workings of the Programme, of Exeter College, and of the University, and will be familiarized with the rules and regulations they are expected to abide by during
their residence in Oxford.
Throughout the academic year, provision will be made for trips to a few of sites of historical, cultural, or political interest. In the past these have included the
Cotswolds, Salisbury, Stratford, Stonehenge, Bath, Wells, Warwick Castle, Blenheim Palace, and various sites of interest in London. Students will also be given
the opportunity to attend a number of theatrical productions and other cultural events. Oxford's proximity to London gives students ready access to that city's
multiple attractions and many resources. The Oxford-London train service is frequent and the journey takes just over an hour. The buses to London run even more
regularly (and are generally cheaper), and the one-way journey takes about ninety minutes.
During the summer before students arrive in Oxford, they will receive a copy of the latest edition of Ephs Among the Dreaming Spires, which will further
explain the perks, policies, and procedures of the Programme, the rules and regulations they are expected to follow, and tips for how best to enjoy a fulfilling year
in and around Oxford.
ILLNESS AND INSURANCE
Students must ensure they are covered either by the Williams College health insurance policy or by some other comprehensive health insurance plan (generally
a family health insurance policy). While in Britain, students will be covered by the National Health Service (NHS) for routine visits at the Group Medical Practice
used by Exeter College and for emergency hospital treatment. The programme also works with a physician in private practice attached to a local private hospital.
Prescription drugs are available through the NHS for a nominal fee. There are limited outpatient psychological counseling services available through the NHS
and the Programme, although, as Visiting Students at the University, Williams students are entitled to make use of the University Counseling Centre. Any exten-
sive or long-term counseling, however, would need to be covered by the student's personal health insurance policy. Finally, students are not likely to be covered
under the NHS for medical services received in foreign countries, especially those countries that do not enjoy membership of the European Union.
FEES
The tuition and room fees paid by students on the Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford are the same as those for a year spent in residence at Williams.
Students are responsible for some of their own meals and for all of their personal expenses. They are also responsible for arranging and funding the cost of their air
travel to and from Britain, although they may select to take the group flight to London arranged by the Programme at competitive rates. They are provided with
three meals a day for the first four or five days in Oxford and with a weekly catered meal in Ephraim Williams House during the eight weeks of term. They may
also eat breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner on any day of the week at Exeter. Students will not be charged the full Williams board fee during their year in Oxford, but
they will pay a proportion of the board fee to help cover these costs. For planning purposes, students and their parents should expect the cost of a year on the
Programme to be roughly the same as a year at Williams. Financial aid eligibility will be figured on the usual basis of tuition, fees, room, board, and personal and
book expenses, as if the student were at Williams for the year. Similarly, the normal self-help contribution would be expected. Since the academic year ends later
at Oxford than at Williams, the summer earning expectations for students for the following year will be reduced by one half and the difference will be made up by
additional Williams aid.
APPLICATION
Admission to the Programme is on a competitive but flexible basis. Students must apply to the Dean's Office by the prescribed deadline (normally early in
February) and, prior to applying, should consult with the chair of their major department. Any questions students might have about curricular offerings at Oxford
can also be raised with the director of the Programme in Oxford. In addition to completing the formal application form, students can expect to be interviewed at
306
Williams and will subsequently need to complete an application for Visiting Student status at Oxford University. All admissions to the Programme are subject to
approval by Exeter College. Students can expect to be notified of acceptance before Spring Break. It is normally expected that they will have completed the
College's distribution requirement by the end of their sophomore year. In making its decisions, the Admissions Committee of the Williams-Exeter Programme at
Oxford University takes student GPA into account, expects all applicants to have demonstrated capacity for rigorous independent work and extensive essay
writing, and looks favorably on those students whose intellectual maturity, curiosity and enthusiasm would best prepare them for a demanding course of study in
Oxford. All applicants must identify two Williams faculty members who are willing to provide references. Because of the emphasis at Oxford on weekly written
work for each tutorial course, at least one of those faculty members should be able to offer an assessment of the applicant's writing ability.

WILLIAMS-MYSTIC MARITIME STUDIES PROGRAM
Director, JAMES T. CARLTON
Faculty: JAMES T. CARLTON (Williams College), LISA GILBERT (Williams College; on assistant professor leave, 0910),GLENN S. GORDINI-
ER (University of Connecticut), CATHERINE ROBINSON HALL (Mystic Seaport Museum), MARY K. BERCAWEDWARDS (University of
Connecticut; Mystic Seaport Museum), RICHARD KING (Mystic Seaport Museum), DIANE BENNETT (Mystic Seaport Museum).
The Williams College-Mystic Seaport Maritime Studies Program offers students a unique opportunity to explore the ocean, travel the Atlantic, Pacific, and
Gulf coasts, and undertake original research of their own design in the humanities and sciences. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors of all majors welcome. A term
at Williams-Mystic includes credit for one semester plus one winter study requirement, as well as intensive writing course credit. Four Williams courses are
offered as an integrated, multidisciplinary curriculum in the semester-long program at Mystic Seaport, in Mystic, Connecticut: Maritime History, Literature of the
Sea, Marine Policy, and either Marine Ecology or Oceanography (see the Maritime Studies section in this catalog). Travel includes an offshore voyage on the
open ocean sailing aboard a tall ship, a seminar along the Pacific Coast, and a Louisiana field seminar, all of which are cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary
exercises. Students live in historic, cooperative, co-ed houses at Mystic Seaport, the world's largest maritime museum, and have full access to world-class mari-
time collections, a maritime library, a state-of-the-art Marine Sciences teaching and research center, and diverse coastal habitats (where field research can be
undertaken in a wide variety of environments, ranging from tidepools and salt marshes to sandy beaches and estuaries). Students also participate in maritime skills
under professional instruction, with choices such as celestial navigation, music of the sea, boat building, or small boat handling and sailing. Williams-Mystic
seeks candidates who are willing to try new things and work in a compelling academic environment. No sailing experience necessary. Participation in Williams-
Mystic can also be used in partial fulfillment of the Maritime Studies Concentration at Williams. Interested students should email admissions@williamsmys-
tic.org, call (860-572-5359), visit the website (www.williams.edu/williamsmystic), or obtain a Williams-Mystic catalog from the Dean's office. Applications are
on the web and at the Dean's office.

WINTER STUDY PROGRAM
REMINDERS ABOUT WSP REGISTRATION
All students who will be on campus during the 2009-2010 academic year must register for WSP. Registration will take place in the early part of fall semester.
If you are registered for a senior thesis in the fall which must be continued through Winter Study by departmental rules, you will be registered for your Winter
Study Project automatically. In every other case, you must complete registration. First-year students are required to participate in a Winter Study that will take
place on campus; they are not allowed to do 99's.
Even if you plan to take a 99, or the instructor of your first choice accepts you during the registration period, there are many things that can happen between
registration and the beginning of Winter Study to upset your first choice, so you must list five choices. You should try to make one of your choices a project with
a larger enrollment, not that it will guarantee you a project, but it will increase your chances.
If you think your time may be restricted in any way (ski meets, interviews, etc.), clear these restrictions with the instructor before signing up for his/her
project.
Remember, for cross-listed projects, you should sign up for the subject you want to appear on your record.
For many beginning language courses, you are required to take the WSP Sustaining Program in addition to your regular project. You will be automatically
enrolled in this Sustaining Program, so no one should list this as a choice.
The grade of honors is reserved for outstanding or exceptional work. Individual instructors may specify minimum standards for the grade, but normally,
fewer than one out of ten students will qualify. A grade of pass means the student has performed satisfactorily. A grade of perfunctory pass signifies that a
student's work has been significantly lacking but is just adequate to deserve a pass.
If you have any questions about a project, see the instructor before you register.
Finally, all work for WSP must be completed and submitted to the instructor no later than January 28, 2010. Only the Dean can grant an extension
beyond this date.
WINTER STUDY 99'S
Sophomores, juniors and seniors are eligible to propose "99's," independent projects arranged with faculty sponsors, conducted in lieu of regular Winter
Study courses. Perhaps you have encountered an interesting idea in one of your courses which you would like to study in more depth, or you may have an
interest not covered in the regular curriculum. In recent years students have undertaken in-depth studies of particular literary works, interned in government
offices, assisted in foreign and domestic medical clinics, conducted field work in economics in developing countries, and given performances illustrating the
history of American dance. Although some 99's involve travel away from campus, there are many opportunities to pursue intellectual or artistic goals here in
Williamstown.
99 forms are available online: http://www.williams.edu/Registrar/winterstudy/99direct.html
The deadline for submitting the proposals to faculty sponsors is October 1, 2009.
AFRICANA STUDIES
AFR 15 Black Independent Cinema (Same as American Studies 17 and English 15)
(See under ENGL 15 for full description.)
AFR 18 Douglass, Davis, Obama: Fugitive Democratic Theory (Same as Political Science 18)
The political theorist Sheldon S. Wolin has asserted that the American republic is a fugitive democracy, a democracy that is unsustainable due to the coercive
norms of political elites and corporate CEOs who rule in advanced industrial capitalist societies. While Wolin's theory is probing, a much more radical critique
and reconstructive conception of American democracy had been developed in the tradition of African-American political thought over two hundred years earlier.
This course shall investigate the life and work of the fugitive-turned-ex-slave Frederick Douglass, the imprisoned intellectual and socialist black feminist Angela
Y. Davis, and the liberal constitutional lawyer-politician Barack Hussein Obama as three examples of fugitive thinkers seeking to refashion the meaning of de-
mocracy in dark times. We will focus our class discussions primarily on Douglass's middle autobiography, My Bondage and My Freedom, Davis's Angela Davis:
An Autobiography, and Obama's Dreams from My Father. We shall supplement analysis of these autobiographical writings with selections from the authors'
critical public speeches, interviews, and essays. Additionally, the class will integrate the viewing of films and documentaries to complement the written texts. The
course shall end with students proposing via an autobiographical video their own vision of what democracy means and what life in a democracy should look like.
Evaluation will be based upon class participation, composition of an autobiographical democracy time capsule video, and an 8-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: $50 for books.
Meeting time: afternoons, two hours per session, TWR.
ROBERTS
AFR 25 Gender, Video, and Social Activism in Senegal
This course builds on the foundation of previous Winter Study Courses run in Senegal, Uganda and Tanzania. This year we propose to introduce students to the
work of non-governmental and grassroots health and social organizations in Senegal, in French West Africa. We will deepen and further develop the model of
collaborative video work with AIDS activists, working with new groups of activists and expanding the work in two important ways. First, we will now train our
African partners in editing as well as filming, leaving them able to make their own videos after we leave. And secondly, we will engage throughout the course in
an explicit and theoretically informed discussion of the use of video in activism, and diverse representations of Africa and HIV in film and video.
The collaborative video work we have been building is proving to be a very powerful tool, both for our students and the African groups we have been partnering
with. One of the videos we made in Senegal in 2008 is now being used nationally to persuade youth to be tested for HIV (the youtube version has already had over
2,500 views:)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDdCRDdg5Xo&feature=channel
and this summer WIT will be developing a webpage to collect and display the videos.
In Senegal as elsewhere, local and national groups have sprung up in response to concerns about poverty, unemployment, disease, and other pressing issues.
Particularly inspiring are a number of AIDS education and awareness groups that women have started up to halt the spread of the disease in their communities and
to offer support to those living with it. Students in this course will get to meet and learn from social and health education activists, such as the DEGGO organiza-
tion in Mbour, a fishing port south of Dakar; Xel ak Xalaat, based in Rufisque, nearer the capital; and AWA, in Dakar.
In addition to gaining an understanding of the breadth, purpose and genesis of social activism in Senegal, students will learn of the mixed effects of Western
commerce and tourism on the country. Non-governmental groups (NGOs), both those run by Senegalese and those directed by foreigners, grapple with the legacy
of French colonial structures and the present-day reality of market capitalism in an impoverished country. These circumstances create a politically complex
backdrop against which NGOs struggle to achieve their goals. As such, part of the work of our Williams group will be to understand the challenges and practical
impediments these NGOs face against a background of pervasive North-South power dynamics and inequality.
Articulated with that analysis will be an analysis of Senegalese gender systems, and their interaction with the political economy and with HIV. Gender has been
widely recognized as a crucial component in the African AIDS pandemic; but it is vital to go beyond generalizations about patriarchal African culture to an
understanding of the contestation over gender within a specific locale. Senegal is a particularly rich case study as a Muslim country where women play a central
role in anti-poverty and AIDS activism.
The winter study will start with 5 days in Williamstown, reading, training in video editing, and preparing background for the experience. After a day of traveling,
we will spend 5 days in Dakar being hosted by ACI (Africa Consultants International, a local NGO), who will provide the students with cultural introductions,
basic Wolof classes, and background lectures on the landscape of HIV and grassroots activism in Senegal. They will also organize homestays with Senegalese
families. We will then move to either Kaolack or Louga, to spend 8 days working with members of 3 or 4 Senegalese NGOs to make collaborative video projects.
Students will be in homestays here again. We will end the trip with a day of debriefing and screening our videos before returning to the US.
Requirements: As well as working on the video projects, students are encouraged to keep a journal of their reflections whilst in Senegal. They will also participate
in a video screening and report back to the Williams community upon return to campus.
Prerequisites: The course is open to sophomores, juniors and seniors. Basic, conversational French strongly recommended and preference will go to students with
some French. Those students who have no French at all are encouraged to enroll in a French language course in fall 2009 if at all possible. Video editing skills will
also be recommended. Enrollment limit: 10. Not open to first-year students.
Cost to student: approximately $3,740.

ANTHROPOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY
ANSO 10 Meditation-Based Stress Reduction: Adopting a Mindfulness Practice (Same as Religion 10)
This course provides an opportunity to actively participate in your own health and well-being. You will be introduced to the concept of mindfulness and guided in
how to create your own mindfulness practice, one that incorporates meditation and yoga. Mindfulness is a way of relating directly to what is happening in your
life, a way of taking charge of your life, a way of doing something for yourself that no one else can do for you--consciously and systematically working with your
own stress, pain, illness and the challenges and demands of collegiate life.
We will meet twice per week for 3-hour sessions of meditation, yoga, and inquiry into the interplay of mind and body in health and illness, calm and stress. We
will also look at the roots of this practice in the Hindu and Buddhist faiths, with specific emphasis on the influence of Buddhist meditation on this secular stress
reduction practice.
Students are required to commit to 30 minutes of mindfulness meditation practice on a daily basis. Additional assignments will include weekly reading of texts
relevant to the course as well as brief presentations of concepts from these texts. You will be evaluated on these presentations, as well as a final paper. Attendance
and participation will also be taken into account.
No prerequisites. Please note: After signing up for the course, please send a brief email statement to the instructor at pbohnert@gmail.com, describing your
interest and objectives for the course. In the event of over-subscription, these statements will be used in the selection process. All queries about this course should
be directed to the instructor, who can be reached at 617-642-5165 or at pbohnert@gmail.com. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: $50 for a yoga mat and two books. Meditation cushions will be provided by the instructor.
Meeting time: twice per week for 3-hour sessions.

ANSO 11 Berkshire Farm Internship
A field placement at Berkshire Farm Center and Services for Youth in Canaan, New York. Berkshire Farm Center is a residential treatment facility for troubled,
at-risk adolescent boys who have been remanded by the Family Court for treatment and intervention. These youths come primarily from lower socio-economic
strata, are very ethnically diverse, and hail from both urban and rural areas throughout New York State. The issues that bring them to placement are mainly a result
of the psychological scars developed from physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. The manifested behaviors include chemical dependency, juvenile delinquency,
inability to function in the school setting, inability to follow the rules at home, running away and/or mental health issues. The residential treatment model is
strength based and focuses on teaching healthy decision making.
Williams students will commute to Berkshire Farm and work under supervision in various settings including school, cottage life, substance abuse program,
recreation, adeventure-based therapy, performing arts, animal husbandry or inidividual tutoring. The students are responsible to be proactive in developing their
learning experience.
Requirements: students will keep a journal reflecting on their experiences, and a weekly seminar with the instructor will draw on service learning experience.
Students will also be required to submit a final 10-page paper at the end of the course.
Prerequisites: YOU MUST HAVE A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH THE INSTRUCTOR, who can be reached at 518-265-6218. Enrollment limit: 15.

ANSO 12 Children and the Courts: Internship in the Crisis in Child Abuse
The incidence of reported child abuse and neglect has reached epidemic proportions and shows no signs of decreasing. Preventive and prophylactic social pro-
grams, court intervention, and legislative mandates have not successfully addressed this crisis. This course allows students to observe the Massachusetts Depart-
ment of Social Services attorney in courtroom proceedings related to the care and protection of children. Students will have access to Department records for
purposes of analysis and will also work with social workers who will provide a clinical perspective on the legal cases under study. The class will meet regularly to
discuss court proceedings, assigned readings, and the students' interactions with local human services agencies. Access to an automobile is desirable but not
required; some transportation will be provided as part of the course.
Requirements: full participation, a journal, and a 10-page paper to be submitted at the end of the course.
Enrollment limit: 15. Please note: all queries about this course must be directed to the instructor, Judge Locke (phone messages may be left at 458-4833).

ANSO 13 Epidemiology, Public Health, and Leadership in the Health Professions (Same as Leadership Studies 13 and Chemistry 17)
Epidemiology, the study of disease and disability in human populations, has been called the basic science of public health and preventive medicine. Epidemiology
has made substantial contributions to the advancement of public health and improved illness care through a deeper understanding of the natural history of disease,
the multiple causes of disease, including the role of behavioral factors, evaluation of the effectiveness of drugs and medical proceedures, and the control of
epidemics of both infectious and (later) non-infectious disease. Making use of unknown epidemic exercies, selected original papers from the medical and public
310
health literature, and a basic text, this course will begin by examining and reviewing the history, logic, and approaches of epidemiology. We will then turn to a
series of seminar discussions of leadership in the health professions based upon historical documents, research papers, videotape, and profiles in the current
media.
With the help of guest lecturers/discussion leaders, we will explore aspects of leadership in at least three of the following areas:
S evaluation of illness care services
S international health, specifically malaria control, drug resistant Tbc, or HIV/AIDS, with special consideration of how best to find the balance between
treatment and prevention in high prevalence countries
S ethics in international experiments in human populations
S behavioral issues in prevention and treatment, perhaps with focus on obesity
S sports injuries, their incidence, prevention and treatment
Evaluation will be based on active participation, especially leadership in group discussions, and a written epidemiologic analysis/critique of a published research
article, perhaps on a topic of personal interest, or a written profile of leadership that is bookworthy (topic to be selected in consultation with instructor).
Prerequisites: curiosity, personal interview, and/or a short essay (1 page or less) stating your reasons for interest in the course and what you think you can contrib-
ute. Enrollment limit: 18. Questions about the course can be directed to the instructor (wrightnh@adelphia.net, 458-5841).
Cost to student: $200 for copying and reading materials.
Meeting time: afternoons, at least 3 times a week, for approximately 8 hours each week, with some late afternoon/evening meetings, depending on the schedule of
guest speakers.

SOCIOLOGY
SOC 11 Verbatim: Adventures in Ethnographic Theater (Same as Theater 11)
Theater, like ethnography, is an art of listening. Documentary theatre, or "verbatim theater," as it is also known, develops this art to an utmost extent: it is a form in
which actor-conducted interviews become the basis for the play, with the interview transcripts providing material for playwriting, as well as the actors' interpreta-
tion of the characters. This course will explore the verbatim technique in practice: after a brief introduction into the history and methods of documentary theater,
the students will choose a theme for a play, develop the framework and conduct their own ethnographic interviews, transform the interview transcripts into a short
play, and finally, collaboratively put on a production that will give new life to the words they hear from their subjects.
Evaluation will be based on the students' production journal, and on their contribution to the creation and performance of the verbatim play, with attendance,
participation and teamwork also taken into account.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference given to Anthropology and Sociology, Theatre and Creative Writing majors.
Cost to student: no more than $50 for books; additional $100 to cover xeroxing costs and a possible trip to New York to see a documentary play.
Meeting time: mornings, three times a week for two-hour sessions. Following the introductory meeting, the course will be workshop-based. Expect to spend
about ten hours per week outside of class to collect and process the interviews and to work on the performance.

ARTH 13 Masterpieces of French Cinema (Same as French 13)
It is well known that France, a small country of 65 million inhabitants, is the world's third largest film producer, after the U.S. and India. This class proposes a look
at some of the highlights of that national cinema, from the 1930s to the present day. Can the term, "masterpiece," borrowed from the history of art, be applied to
film? If so, what are the criteria for judging a masterpiece? Why is it that Jean Renoir produced a string of masterpieces in France in the 1930s and in the U.S. in
the 1940s, only mediocre fare? Can we consider Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1943 film, Le Corbeau [The Raven] a masterpiece, if we know that the film is ideologi-
cally compromised because produced by the occupying German forces? Is age a pre-requisite for considering a work of art a masterpiece? What is the difference
between a masterpiece and a commercial success? Are there any French women who have created masterpieces in film? Finally, can we discern any common
elements in the background of filmmakers who produce great films? The class will focus primarily on examples of the genre, art cinema, and will feature works
by the following filmmakers: Renoir, Clouzot, Carn, Bresson, Godard, Varda, Kurys, Dumont and Kechiche.
Requirements: attendance, participation and three 2-page papers.

ART STUDIO
ARTS 10 Art in Community
Today, there are many artists who work in and with communities to create works of art that connect creativity directly to people's lives. Their art arises out of
relationships they build and research they carry out with and within a community. This approach, often referred to as community-based public art, has a set of
demands and challenges that are very different from traditional art-making practices. It involves data collection using personal interviews and oral histories,
observation, and investigation into the cultural context of a specific place or group. It also requires the ability to negotiate difference--race, class, gender--in
order to make a space for dialogue.
This course is designed to develop an understanding of these community-based public-art-making practices. The class will be taught in and beyond the class-
room, expanding the context of the Williams campus into the broader Berkshire regional community. Students will work with Macarthur Fellow Pepon Osorio,
renowned for his community-based public art projects, to get first-hand experiences of how he works and how he collaborates with his subjects. They will also
311
study similar projects by other artists working in the United States and abroad.
Students will learn the skills necessary for interviewing community members, local leaders, and fellow students. They will use their research and study of Oso-
rio's method to create a conceptual design for an art project of their own based on journals they keep during the course and an original theme that arises from their
experiences.
The class will explore a number of challenging questions, and emphasis will be placed on an artist's responsibility when working with communities and in
neighborhoods. How is this practice a form of public art as opposed to social work? Where is the "object" of art located in community-based practice? What is at
stake when an artist goes into a relatively unknown environment and engages it in an artwork? How can the artist be sure that the collaboration does not exploit the
participants for the artist's own gain? Can art that claims to be socially responsible really be socially transformative?
This class is a hands-on, experiential course. Students will work in groups and one-on-one with the instructor to develop a personal approach to community space
and personal narrative. Students will be required to keep a journal record of their experiences and to participate in orchestrating the dialogues described above. For
the final project each student will be expected to make a substantial presentation that both summarizes the research that was carried out and reflects on the
student's artistic and personal growth through the process.
Students will be expected to work with the artist in the field as well as to engage in active discussion about the artistic process described above. During the days
when the artist is not in residence in Williamstown they will be assigned specific research to carry out to be presented during the class sessions.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. Darra Goldstein and Lisa Corrin will interview prospective students.
Cost to student: no more than $50.
Meeting time: an intensive workshop that meets 2 days each week of the winter study period.

He is a professor at Temple University's Tyler School of Art. He is currently working on a project in the Berkshires focusing on food--how it unites and divides
us as a community. As one aspect of their practicum, students will orchestrate a series of dialogues to bring people from widely diverging backgrounds into
conversation about food and identity. These conversations will ultimately be integrated into an installation that WCMA has commissioned for the summer
of 2010.
ARTS 11 Sources of Inspiration: Shamans, Beatniks and Analysts
Artists have often turned to other cultures and earlier time periods for inspiration. This course is an introduction to a diverse range of influential sources such as
alchemy, shamanic rituals, automatic writing, outsider art, collective consciousness and mysticism. Focus will be on using these primary sources as catalysts for
making art. By linking form or content to contemporary ideas, original material can be transformed. The resulting work can resonate in new and relevant ways.
Classes will evolve from slide lectures and group discussions to more open-ended studio time, group critiques and individual conferences.
Evaluation will be based on class participation, assignments and a final project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: variable.
Meet time: afternoons, twice a week. Some outside reading and an additional 6 to 8 hours a week of studio time will be expected.

ARTS 13 The Visual Display of Information: Building Timelines
Information graphics attempt to look at complex information or data of variously layered and dense construction in order to build visual strategies for organizing
that information and re-presenting it in clear forms. Diagrams, maps and sign systems are asked to present this information quickly and in easily accessible visual
terms. This course will examine the selection of those design choices (color, shape, text, font, static or dynamic feeds, levels of interactivity, etc.).
The specific project of the class will be to assemble static and dynamic timelines that reveal the history of diversity at Williams College and to contextualize these
events with regional, national and international proceedings. Good infographics can reveal information long lost, provide easy access to events and participants
(journalistic reporting, film and audio documentation, interviews). This project offers our community access to a past-honoring those who helped shape diversity
at Williams- and help reveal what remains to be yet accomplished.
Students will be expected to complete original research, develop best means of graphically translating that research and participate in design discussions about
best practice means of visual communication. Readings, study of information graphic systems, design studio work (primarily computer based) and classroom
discussions will occupy our studio work sessions of six hours per week. Students should expect to commit a minimum of 20 additional hours per week of work.
Studio sessions will be combined with lectures and visiting designers.
Evaluation will be based on individual work/research contributed to development of overall project; exhibition of finished visual project, written documentation/
analysis of overall project.
Prerequisites: familiarity with Illustrator, Photoshop required; knowledge of web platform software, WordPress, desirable. Enrollment limit: 12. If overenrolled,
selection will be based on portfolio review.
Cost to student: $100.
Meeting time: afternoons.
EPPING
ARTS 14 A Smaller Better Home
Members of this seminar/studio will inquire into residential architecture's power to shape individual lives as well as to make a positive difference on the way that
people live on the earth. As we look at the American Home function by function, students will design or write about a home, room by room. We'll discuss what
works and what doesn't serve life in the present. We will explore and apply architecture's intersection with behavioral science, psychology and philosophy in
words and/ or designs. Selected reading in support of seminar topics will be requried.
Our funal project will be the design, collage or written description of a 1500 SF home. Although beauty matters, our focus will be on ideas and spaces that shape
healthier, happier and more affordable lifestyles rather than designing objets d'art.
As they design or write, students will be encouraged to stretch their imaginations by considering questions such as: What are the greatest stressors and irritants in
modern life? What conditions stimulate happiness and contribution? How do we design and arrange rooms so that they work for people and for neighborhoods?
How does a home shape a "good life"? The intended outcome of this course is that participants will gain an exponential increase in their ability to impact the
future through writing, speaking and design.
Format: seminar. Evaluation will be based on presentations, participation, short papers, sketches and a final project. The final project is to design and present the
plans or collage or a 10-page written description of a 3- to 4-bedroom home of 1,500 SF.
Prerequisites: ArtS 220 Architectural Design I or ArtS 211 The Sample or ArtS 100 Drawing I or ArtH 562 Themes in Domestic Architecture. EXPR/ArtS/
MATH/MUS 309/PHIL 307 Exploring Creativity. Students who have completed one of the following: AMST 201, 405, 221, 364 may apply but must demon-
strate an ability to draw or write four 3-page papers in lieu of the sketch problems. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference will be given to juniors and senior majors in
Art, Architecture, American Studies, Psychology and Philosophy. If overenrolled, final selection will be based on an interview/portfolio review.
Meeting time: afternoons and occassional evenings, two 2-hour seminars per week; following each seminar will be a 2- to 3-hour long studio for pin ups and/or
brief oral presentations; students have the option of working on their weekly assignments in studio (during that time, individual critiques will be given.

ARTS 15 The Glass Art Movement: Experiencing Glass Through History and Practice
This year the Glass Art Movement turns 50. That's right, in 1960 a group of intelligent and energetic american artists with one common interest came together and
brought hot glass out of the factory and into the studio. Until this point glass had not been available as a material for artistic expression at least not one that the artist
himself could work with his or her own hands. During this WSP we will investigate this material and it's use in expression and creativity by reliving this emer-
gence. We will begin by building a small simple glass melting furnace and annealing oven while learning about the qualities and technical nuances of this aston-
ishing liquid=There are no pre-requisites. or is it a solid?
312
We will study the history of its use for the past 3,500 years as decoration or as an object of function. With this information and experience with the medium each
artist will present a proposal for a project that uses glass as the main material for creation of a work or works of art. The finished works will be on display to the
entire student body at the end of the WSP. Students will be required to be in the studio four days a week minimum as well as participate in one weekend field trip
to Salem Art Works. Students will be expected to spend several hours outside of class researching the history and techniques of glass making as well as working
on their projects. There will be a variety of field experiences offered but not required.
Evaluation will be base on three things: participation, proposal and completion of a well developed project for final gallery show.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. Preference given to Arts double majors, then Arts majors.
Cost to student: $300.

ARTS 18 Figure Drawing
In this course students will develop representational, technical, and expressive skills through studies in drawing from the life model. We will inform our practice in
drawing through the study of accomplished figure drawings from the history of western art. Creating your own studies "in the manner of" such drawings, you will
learn to develop methods suitable for varied approaches to the human figure. In addition to working directly from the model during class meetings, you will also
be expected to develop drawings outside of class times, including anatomical studies, self portraiture, and working up figure sketches into more developed com-
positions. In addition to studio work we will allow some time for brief slide lectures and for critique.
Evaluation will be based on the level of achievement in the drawings, attendance, participation, and effort. Satisfactory performance in the course will require a
commitment of at least 5 hours per week in addition to class meetings.
Prerequisites: ArtS 100. Enrollment limit: 12.

ASTRONOMY
ASTR 10 Applied Aerodynamics
The myth of Icarus illustrates the powerful attraction of flight. Some of us love the very notion of moving through the air with three full spatial degrees of freedom.
While many of us do this routinely inside large aluminum tubes, personally flying an aircraft adds another dimension of excitement. Though we will not be flying
full-size airplanes, we can do a great deal with miniature aircraft in an indoor setting. The course will be conducted in semi-tutorial fashion, with student presenta-
tions, construction sessions, flying sessions, and traditional lectures. We will cover the history and physics of heavier-than-air flight (balloons are boring!). No
previous experience or coursework is required-students will learn the necessary fundamentals in class. On the practical side, students will start out building and
flying simple gliders. Students will eventually build a remote-controlled aircraft (fixed- or rotary-wing), and learn to fly it. The course will culminate with our own
airshow.
Evaluation will be based on completion of projects, student presentations, and a 5-page paper on some aspect of the material.
No prerequisites other than enthusiasm for flight and willingness to learn some basic physics. Enrollment limit: 6. Selection will be based on a one-paragraph
essay on why the student wants to take the course.
Cost to student: approximately $250-300 for materials.
Meeting time: approximately six 2-hour sessions per week (some mornings and some afternoons) for lectures, flight instruction, and construction; outside-class
work will include reading and preparation of presentations.
SOUZA
ASTR 12 Pluto and Other Dwarf Planets
The repercussions of the International Astronomical Union's reclassification of Pluto from "planet" to "dwarf planet" have not settled down, with worldwide
discussions continuing and books being published about the process and the result. In 2008, the outer dwarf planets were named Plutoids, to give Pluto some
additional honor; the ones now known are Pluto, Eris, Makemake, and Haumea. Haumea is now undergoing eclipses and transits with its moon Namaka, which
should lead to improved understanding of Haumea and its system. We will discuss not only the objects itself and related science (Williams College faculty and
students have been studying Pluto's atmosphere with telescope observations) but also the philosophy of naming and of classification. Why is Europe a continent?
Why is India a subcontinent? Classification problems extend into biological naming and into many other systems. And how should names be chosen? The
Plutoids include names from Roman, Greek, Easter Island, and Hawaiian mythologies. In this Winter Study course, students will have flexibility to consider
aspects of the overall subject that interest them. On a field trip to New York, we will visit the Rose Center for Earth and Space in its architectural wonder of a glass
enclosure surrounding its Hayden Sphere, which contains the planetarium. The Rose Center was a first place where Pluto was "demoted," leading to a front-page
article in The New York Times on the subject. We will also visit the Rubin Museum of Art, with its scheduled exhibition Envisioning the Cosmos: from Milky
Ocean to Black Hole, to which Prof. Pasachoff is lending books. ["The exhibition spans a diversity of religions, cultures and epochs, examining the ways in which
we have interpreted our place in the universe. The first part of the exhibition will display the theocentric cosmologies of Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain religions,
which envision deities as creators, preservers, and primary players in the cosmic construct. The second section will trace how Western medieval anthropocentric
cosmology, which envisioned humans at the center of a static universe, was replaced in the Renaissance by a heliocentric universe, which gave rise to the present
evolving astrophysical world-view. The exhibition will include manuscripts, books, paintings, and sculptures depicting the various and frequently complex con-
cepts, diagrams, systems, and stories that describe the creation and structure of the universe. In addition to original artworks, the exhibition will feature education-
al models of the universe. This will allow visitors to better understand the cosmological objects presented in the show, but also how modern we view the cosmos
in this age of science. There will be a room that allows virtual travel through the universe, using an interactive device produced by the American Museum of
Natural History and adapted for the RMA show. There will also be a computer animation of the Buddhist cosmos (Kalacakra)."]
Students will be expected to participate in all activities, to read at least two books about the Pluto/dwarf-planet situation, and to write a 5-page paper and a
concluding 10-page paper on a subject of individual choice.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference awarded on the basis of a brief email letter, if oversubscribed.
Cost to student: $100 for the field trip to New York; optional $25 for books .

BIOL 11 Global Health: Why We Should Care
From the Declaration of Alma-Ata to the Millennium Development Goals, there have been 30 years of good will but limited accomplishment in bringing health to
all. Health is an essential human right, but much of the world's poor still do not have access to the most basic public health services. This is best illustrated in
Africa where there is the double burden of poverty and communicable disease. The failure to provide equitable health and the emergence of new infectious
diseases with pandemic potential also threaten world security. This winter study will explore what is meant by global health, how health is measured and what are
the major diseases that particularly affect the poor. It will take a biomedical approach focusing on communicable diseases, e.g. HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculo-
314
sis, and pandemic influenza, but will also look at maternal and child health, and bringing humanitarian aid to those in need. After defining the problems, we will
explore strategies in the control of disease and achieving global health.
A variety of formats will be used to study global health issues including the current medical literature, popular writings and film documentaries. We will look at
the science of global health and the story of those most affected by the inequalities of health. Students are expected to read assigned material outside of class so
that they will be prepared to discuss the topics. Short presentations on a focused area will also be expected. We will formally meet three times weekly for two
hours each session.
Evaluation will be based on contributions to class discussions, informal presentations and a 10-page paper that can: analyze a global health issue, be a document
defining a public health intervention, or a short story describing the impact of a disease or condition on an individual, family or community.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: approximately $25-35 book and article packet.

BIOL 14 In the Blink of an Eye (Same as ArtS 22)
In this interdisciplinary course where Art and Science intersect, we will use drawing and video to investigate structures of motion in animate and inanimate
objects. Assuming that even the simplest gesture is a dynamic event, we will examine the transitory expressions of the human face and bodily gesture in their
response to stimuli. We will also look at gestures of inanimate objects in motion. When enlisting the Biology Department's high-speed video camera (with the
capacity to film upwards of 50,000 frames per second), ordinary events appear startlingly unordinary. In addition to filming, we will use drawing as a tool to
examine gesture. Using a figure model and our own bodies for reference, we will draw sequences based on a gesture's trajectory. To contextualize this study we
will examine the work of artists and scientists whose work responds to structures of motion in time and space.
Students are expected to attend class, complete weekly assignments, and keep an on-going journal of motion studies. Students will be evaluated on their class
attendance, their participation in discussions, and the quality of their assignments and final presentation.
No prerequisites but some drawing experience helpful. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference based on individual letters of interest.
Cost to student: $75.
Meeting time: mornings.

BIOL 21 Science Beyond Williams
Are you interested in hands-on experience in a science-related field beyond the Purple Valley? Are you curious to explore science in a university or medical
school research lab, a government agency, or a not-for-profit organization? This course is designed to help students take part in scientific work or research going
on outside of Williams in order to provide them with a broader sense of what it is like to work in a professional scientific setting. Any field of science or technolo-
gy can be explored via this course.
In consultation with the course instructor, students will use resources such as the Office of Career Counseling, science faculty members, and Williams alumni/ae
to locate a mentor in the student's area of interest at a work site in the United States. Once the course instructor approves the arrangement for a mentored, hands-on
experience for three weeks of Winter Study, the student will prepare for the internship by reading literature related to the project, and discuss the readings with a
faculty sponsor here at Williams in November/December. Once on site, students must remain in contact with their Williams faculty sponsor by having a weekly
phone conference. Participating students would not have to be on campus during WSP prior to beginning their fieldwork. Strong interest, enthusiasm and willing-
ness to plan and prepare for the internship are required for this course.
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page paper and post-WSP public presentation to a relevant department or program on the goals and accomplishments of the
project.
Prerequisites: two semesters of relevant course work in science and/or mathematics. Enrollment limit: 10.

T. SMITH
CHEM 11 Science for Kids (Same as Special 11)
Are you interested in teaching? Do you enjoy working with kids? Do you like to experiment with new things? Here is a chance for you to do all three! The aim of
this Winter Study Project is to design a series of hands-on science workshops for elementary school children and their parents. Working in teams of 2-4, students
spend the first two and a half weeks of Winter Study planning the workshops. This involves deciding on a focus for each workshop (based on the interests of the
students involved) followed by choosing and designing experiments and presentations that will be suitable for fourth-grade children. On the third weekend of
Winter Study (January 23, 24) we bring elementary school kids with their parents to Williams to participate in the workshops.
You get a chance to see what goes into planning classroom demonstrations as well as a sense of what it's like to actually give a presentation. You find that kids at
this age are great fun to work with because they are interested in just about everything and their enthusiasm is infectious. You also give the kids and their parents a
chance to actually do some fun hands-on science experiments that they may not have seen before, and you are able to explain simple scientific concepts to them in
a manner that won't be intimidating. It is a rewarding experience for all involved.
Evaluation is based on participation in planning and running the workshops. Each group is expected to prepare a handout with descriptions of the experiments for
the kids, parents, and teachers.
No prerequisites. You need not be a science major; all that is needed is enthusiasm. Enrollment limit: 25.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: mornings. Classes meet three times a week for approximately three hours each session. The workshop is run on the third weekend of Winter Study
(January 23, 24) and attendance from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. is mandatory that weekend. There are also one or two brief meetings held in the fall term for prelimi-
nary planning.

CHEM 12 Current Research in Renewable Energy and Energy Storage
In this course we focus on scientific research in clean and renewable energy, with two goals in mind. First, students learn about the underlying science behind
current technological approaches in the area of energy harvesting and storage. We start with an overview of traditional and renewable energy resources, from the
perspective of magnitudes of scale: how much energy do we consume, how much can we harvest from different sources, how much do we anticipate consuming
in the future, both here in the US and worldwide? We'll then turn to looking at current research in technologies that are being developed to address worldwide
energy needs, focusing primarily on photovoltaic, battery, and fuel cell technologies. We'll approach these topics by looking at fundamental scientific principles
that underlie their operation (particularly from the perspective of materials chemistry), and move into new areas of research and strategies for optimizing their
performance. We'll touch on issues of fabrication, efficiency, and costs. The course will incorporate a variety of field trips (mandatory) to nearby installations
and/or fabrication facilities. The second goal of the course will be to develop materials that can be used in communicating these concepts to a general audience,
and to students in elementary, middle, and high school. We'll work on developing course materials (taking advantage of advice and experience of local teachers)
that can be incorporated into science curricula for students at different levels.
Readings for the course will be based on general interest and review articles from the current scientific literature. Evaluation will be based on homework assign-
ments, a final project, and class participation. The final project will involve the development of curricular materials (lesson plans, demonstrations, web-based
materials, analyses of installations in the area) that can be used to communicate and incorporate these ideas into elementary, middle, and high school level curricu-
la.
Prerequisite: A semester of college level chemistry or physics, or by permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference is given to first-year students and
sophomores and those with an expressed interest in science education.
Cost to student: $50 (books, handouts, general supplies for demonstrations/hands-on experiments).
Meeting time: mornings; MTW and a few mandatory field trips (4-5 hours each).

CHEM 14 Beyond Hooking Up: Creating Meaningful Relationships (Same as Psychology 14 and Special 11)
Looking back on past loves and crushes, have you ever wondered "What on earth was I thinking?!" or "Why do I keep picking the wrong guys/girls for me?"
While intense sexual attraction may once have been calling the shots, research actually shows that people who are in loving relationships tend to be happier,
healthier and more productive in their lives than those who aren't. So how do we get there from here and make sense of all this? Well, no matter where you are on
the dating spectrum, this course is for you if you are ready to learn how to follow your heart, your mind and co-create a fulfilling relationship. The Myers-Briggs
Type Indicator and the AWARE Inventory will guide this interactive relationship mastery course through meaningful discussions and exercises that explore the
common issues, dirty fighting tactics, hidden expectations and emotional allergies that often sabotage relationships. Experiential exercises, personal experiences
and journaling will also give you the opportunity to practice effective communication and conflict resolution skills that honor the constructive use of differences
and promote intimacy.
Evaluation is based on attendance, class participation, inventory completion, assigned readings, journaling, assignments, 1:1 consultations, and final 10-page
reflective paper. Email your statement of interest if you are ready and willing to take your relationships to the next level.

CHEM 25 Archaeology in Ethiopia (Same as Anthropology 25)
Professor Kappelman, paleontologist at UT-Austin, has invited students to participate in his excavations in northwest Ethiopia in January 2010. Longstanding
debates in human evolution concern where our species, modern Homo sapiens, originated, and how the species dispersed throughout Europe and Asia. The oldest
fossils of modern human aspect have all come from Ethiopia; at 195 kyr from Kibish and at 160 kyr from Herto in the Middle Awash. A potential dispersal route
over the southern end of the Red Sea was recently strengthened by the discovery of a coastal site in Eritrea dated to 125 kyr. Professor Kappelman's site contains
Middle Stone Age tools, and evidence that the area might have served as a refugium during times of climate stress. Dating the occupation would indicate whether
the site might have been one of the essential ones in human development.
We will meet before the December break to go over a reading packet that includes both theoretical and practical aspects of the trip. We will leave on January 5, be
on site from January 7-21, and returning on January 24, 2010. Most of the time will be spent in site activities such as excavation, cataloging, and artifact conserva-
tion. However, we will also take some excursions to local villages and, at the end of the time, visit Gondar, an Ethiopian capital in the 19th century.
Evaluation will be based primarily on participation in site activities. Upon return (or earlier if possible) students will write a 5-10 page paper on either the dig or on
some other aspect of Ethiopian culture covered during side trips.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limited to 6. Not open to first-year students.
Cost to student: approximately $2000 for travel and supplies. Students will need a current passport.
Meeting time: daily for at least 6 hours, depending on weather.

ECON 11 Public Speaking
This course will help students become effective and organized public speakers, whether public speaking means giving a class presentation, participating in a
debate, or giving a formal speech before a large audience. We will primarily use extemporaneous and prepared class presentations as a means of learning this skill,
but we will also study the great American speeches and presidential debates of the twentieth century for further insights into persuasive public speaking tech-
niques. The class will provide a supportive environment to help each student create his or her own public speaking style that is comfortable, confident, and
conversational. We will also focus on organizational techniques, handling visual aids effectively, eye contact and body language. Finally, receiving feedback and
providing constructive criticism to other students in the class will be an important part of the course.
Requirements: 5-6 oral presentations to the class, most of which will be videotaped and critiqued. Evaluation will be based on in-class presentations, class partici-
pation, and a 10-page written critique of the student's own videotaped presentations.

ECON 12 Island at the Center of the World: Early and Contemporary Views of New York City Using Google Earth (Same as American
Studies 12, Environmental Studies 11 and History 12)
The course provides an introduction to the special characteristics of the "Island at the Center of the World" and methodologies to interpret its built form. The
students will develop a working understanding of the characteristics of lower Manhattan's residential, vacant and publicly-owned land markets setting the frame-
work for examining land price trends from the days of New Amsterdam to the Wall Street of the future for the world's financial center through the study of
primary source documents. Student will learn the use of geographic information tools such as Sketch-up and Google Earth 4.3 to examine the evidence of a
prototype area of 17th century New Amsterdam, later named New York City, and compare it to today's built form.
Examination of the evidence of its built form and the use of primary source documents to enable the students to develop their own interpretation of the settlement
patterns and economic conditions that have influenced the development of the "Island at the Center of the World" today and yesterday is the subject matter of the
course. Training in the use of Sketch-up and Google Earth 4.3 will be part of the curriculum.
Initially, the course will focus on historical land price change and the current land market to assess the impact of September 11, 2001 on the course of such trends.
Examination of smart growth options, community preservation and policy change within this urban land market in transition requires an understanding of the
influence that transportation improvements, waterfront access and land value change have on housing development, the cost and benefit of open space and the
potential for preservation and re-use of old buildings for housing.
Land policy options will be analyzed using spatial analysis techniques and geographic information systems to assess the importance of location, land use regula-
tion, property tax policy, public investment, open space and other economic factors on land value and property development potential.
Particular attention will be paid to land form and function, infrastructure and economic development, trading practices, and land policies and financing strategies.
The material culture and population characteristics of the Native American, African American and European settlers will be examined through a review of geo-
graphic, economic and environmental conditions that have influenced regional development.
Supervised lab sessions and group critiques will provide feedback on student work. Evaluation will be based on completion of a "digital" interpretive model of a
selected building that was part of the New Amsterdam's 1660 Castello Plan with attention to content, effort and development of the "digital model", based on
individual review of primary source documents and archaeological evidence and the student's preparation of a minimum 10 page final paper. Attendance and
participation will also be taken into account. Exhibition and presentation of the work on the last day of the Winter Study is required.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: $75 including approximately $50 for books.
Students must have access to a College computer with Google Earth and Sketchup or supply their own lap top computer equipped with this.
Meeting times: mornings, twice a week for three-hour sessions. Most of the development work will be completed outside the classroom..

ECON 13 Introduction to Indian Cinema
Popular Indian cinema ("Bollywood") is arguably India's premier cultural export. Audiences across the world, including the Indian diaspora, enjoy the spectacle:
the song-and-dance, the family melodrama, and the "dialogues." Most of us don't think analytically about these films, but there is a small but growing academic
literature that does. This work has identified some recurring themes: the idea of the nation, the threats it faces, and the ideological responses. The course will be
organized around representation of the nation in Indian cinema, and will introduce you to both the analysis and the sheer fun.
We will meet twice a week to watch the films (a total of seven) and twice a week for discussion. Students will write a 2 page response to each film. Reading will
consist of film analysis and also some background reading on India.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. If over-enrolled, preference will be given to students who have previously taken a course on South Asia.
Cost to student: $25 for readings.
Meeting time: afternoons.

will include discussion of the principles involved in accounting for current assets, plant assets, leases, intangible assets, current liabilities, stockholders' equity, the
income statement and the statement of cash flows. Students will be expected to interpret and analyze actual financial statements. The nature of, and career oppor-
tunities in, the field of accounting will also be discussed. The project is a "mini course." It will present a substantial body of material and will require a consider-
able commitment of time by the student, including regular attendance and participation in discussion and homework cases and problems.
The course is a web-based course. The course website will include required readings from various linked web sites, additional downloadable reading material,
required homework problems as well as self study material.
The course should meet for two hours on each Monday, Tuesday and Thursday of every week of Winter Study except the last week when classes should meet on
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
The course grade will be determined on the basis of several quizzes and a written group report presenting an analysis of a company's annual report.

500, etc.), how to read the financial news, historical rates of return on stocks and portfolios, role of mutual funds, beta coefficients, and "random walk" theory. The
course will also involve a brief introduction to financial reports of firms and analysis of financial ratios.
The course is a web-based course. The course website will include required readings from various linked web sites and required homework problems.
Each student will participate in discussions, do some homework assignments and, as part of a team, give two presentations and write a 10-page report analyzing
the wisdom or folly of having chosen a particular investment portfolio.
Not intended for students who already know much about the stock market; students who have had Economics 317 not admitted.
The course should meet for two hours on each Monday, Tuesday and Thursday of every week of Winter Study except last week when classes should meet
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
The course grade will be determined on the basis of performance on several quizzes and a written group investment portfolio report.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30.
Cost to student: Pdownloading from course website approx. 100 pages of material.
Meeting time: afternoons.

ECON 16 AIG and the Global Financial Crisis
Focusing particularly on the role of derivatives, and particularly the credit default swaps created and sold by AIG, in the unfolding global financial crisis, this
course will give an overview of the development and growth of the principal types of U. S. financial institutions (commercial banks and thrifts, securities firms,
insurance companies, hedge funds, etc.), the historical development of U.S. and foreign regulation of these institutions, comparisons with the thrift crisis and the
Long Term Capital Management debacles of the 1990's, the importance of addressing global systemic risk more comprehensively and effectively, and the current
proposals and prospects for doing so. The course will include selective readings from a number of books and articles on the subject. We anticipate inviting a
number of current and former private and public sector participants in the current crisis, as well as commentators on possible changes in the system. The course is
intended to help interested students understand more about the development of the U. S. financial system and the significance of the current crisis to jobs and the
economy. The format will be lecture and discussion. Evaluation will be based on active class participation and debate, including class presentation and defense of
short written papers on various aspects of the subject. There will be no written tests or final examination.
There are no prerequisites.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: mornings.

ECON 17 Understanding Current Economic Issues
The goal of this course is to leave the students with an understanding of how the economy works and how it interacts with financial markets. We will examine
some of the critical issues facing the economy today, in light of historical events and the instructor's extensive experience as a Wall Street economist. The class
will explore the dynamic relationship between the financial markets and the economy beginning with a real-time forecast of U.S. Gross Domestic Product
(GDP).
The course will build upon principles of both macro and microeconomics, but welcomes students from other disciplines. It will provide an introduction to the
work done by business economists and will examine topics chosen by the students. We will look at relationships between key economic variables, movements
in interest rates, the behavior of the dollar, oil prices and inflation. There will be class discussions of business cycles, credit cycles, long waves and past stock-
market bubbles. We will also have several invited guests from the Wall Street investment world speaking on various aspects of the stock market.
The class will meet 3-4 times per week in the morning. Each student should expect to spend a reasonable amount of time on homework, to participate in short
presentations as well as in class discussions. There will be a formal presentation to Williams faculty and others during the last week, supported by a short
written report designed for today's business audience.
An economic database, chart-generating software and a proprietary, statistical analysis program will be available to each student on the Jesup computers. Use
will be made of Excel spreadsheets, charts and PowerPoint.
Requirements: 3- to 5-page paper and presentation.
Prerequisites: Economics 110 or another semester course in Economics is strongly recommended. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: about $20 for text and other materials.
Meeting time: mornings. Because essential concepts and tools are covered during the first week, all students are required to attend the first class.

ECON 18 Discover Modern Chinese Economy through the Lens of Data
China is today a transitional economy; that is, it is an economy in transition from planned socialism to capitalism. The unique combination of the two traditionally
opposite economic forms empowers China's continuous, rapid and stable growth over the past two decades. This course will provide an overview of diverse
backgrounds of Chinese economy and guide students to explore, understand and analyze the dynamic transformation of Chinese economy and society. Major
topics of the course include: economic reform and development, poverty reduction and income disparity, education and gender discrimination, rural-urban dispar-
ity in well-being, population growth and one child policy, migrant workers and urban development. As a group, we will explore data from the China Health and
Nutrition Survey in order to analyze some of these topics.
Evaluation will be based on the effort, content and presentation of the group project. Attendance and participation will also be taken into account. We will meet
twice a week for three-hour sessions in computer lab. Each session will involve discussion of topics and data along with short background films.
Prerequisites: Economics 110 and/or 120 are preferred, but not required. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference will be given to Economics majors and Asian Studies
majors.
Cost to student: $25-50 for reference book.
Meeting time: afternoons.

ECON 19 LaTeX for the Rest of Us
Do you want to impress your professors and fellow students with beautifully formatted papers, theses and books? Then you should learn LaTeX, an elegant and
free software suite for typesetting and document preparation. It is especially good at formatting math, hence its popularity among mathematicians and those in the
natural sciences. But the LaTeX suite also includes a number of compelling features for "the rest of us" who use relatively little or even no math in our writing:
features that include powerful tools for managing references, formatting tables and figures, the creation of presentation slides, and built-in PDF file generation.
This "how-to" course is geared towards students in any field; those in the social sciences, such as economics, should find it especially useful. You don't have to be
a computer expert to learn LaTeX, and no programming experience is required-the only two prerequisites are a modest degree of computer literacy, and an
appreciation for the beauty of the printed page. Evaluation will be based on a final project.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit 10. Preference to Economics majors.
Cost to student: $50 for reference book.
Meeting time: mornings.

ECON 23 Introduction to the Economics, Geography and Appreciation of Wine
This course provides an introduction to the economics, geography and appreciation of wine. We will be studying the economics and geography of wine produc-
tion, and will also learn to identify, understand and appreciate the major wine types of the world. The course will involve lectures, outside readings, and in-class
wine tastings. We will focus primarily on Old World wine styles, namely the world class wine regions of France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Hungry, and Portugal,
but will occasionally make comparisons to analogous New World style wines.
Evaluation will be based on short quizzes, including blind tastings, and either an oral presentation or 10-page paper at the conclusion of the course.
Enrollment limit: 10. Since the course will include wine tastings, it will also be restricted to those who are of legal age for wine consumption by the date of the first
class meeting. In the event that demand exceeds the maximum limit for the course, students will be selected primarily on the basis of their academic record, with
some consideration given to creating a balanced mix of backgrounds and interests among participants. Although this course is fun and interesting, it is also a
serious course in which students are expected to learn the materials and skills presented in the lectures and wine tastings.
Cost to student: $200.
Meeting time: Tuesdays and Thursdays 7-10pm.

ECON 30 Honors Project
The "Specialization Route" to the degree with Honors in Economics requires that each candidate take an Honors Winter Study Project in January of their senior
year. Students who wish to begin their honors work in January should submit a detailed proposal. Decisions on admission to the Honors WSP will be made in the
fall. Information on the procedures will be mailed to senior majors in economics early in the fall semester.
Seniors who wish to apply for admission to the Honors WSP and thereby to the Honors Program should register for this WSP as their first choice.
Some seniors will have begun honors work in the fall and wish to complete it in the WSP. They will be admitted to the WSP if they have made satisfactory
progress. They should register for this WSP as their first choice.
ECON 31 Honors Thesis
To be taken by students participating in year-long thesis research (ECON 493-W31-494).
ECON 51 The Practice of Monetary Policy
This course will cover four practical aspects of modern monetary policy, with a focus on issues relevant to emerging market economies. We will begin with a
discussion of the objectives of monetary policy--inflation, output, and financial stability-and the implications of conflicts between these objectives. We will
move next to the topic of monetary policy transmission: how the central bank's policy instrument affects the financial markets and the broader economy. The third
topic ecompasses central bank independence, and the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy. We will conclude with a consideration of alternative policy
frameworks, with particular attention to inflation targeting.
Requirements and evaluation: three short papers and a case study.

ECON 52 Research in Development Economics
This course introduces students to the craft of posing a good research question in development economics. The instructor will direct students to a topic based both
on the instructor's research pursuits (which include microfinance, liberalization and reform, black markets and agricultural trade) and the student's intellectual
interests. The student will then independently conduct library research, literature surveys (and in some cases, empirical research) on the topic. Students will be
required to make weekly in-class presentations and write a substantial research paper.
Evaluation: 15-20 page final paper.
Prerequisites: Economics 251. Interested students must consult with the faculty instructor before electing this course. Enrollment limit: 6 (if the course is overen-
rolled, the instructor will decide on whom to admit based on research interests and background of students).
Cost to student: none.

ECON 53 Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Modeling: Construction and Analysis
A common tool for applied policy work is the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. These models are used extensively by various NGO's when
deciding aid and policy recommendations. Advanced undergraduates or masters students can attain a basic understanding of these models in a relatively short
time frame. The great advantage of these models is that they capture the general equilibrium feedback effects of policy proposals on various sectors of the econo-
my. This is of great importance in applied work, as this allows the identification of the winners and losers from potential policies. The class will begin with a
general overview of CGE models, followed by a detailed construction of a simple model for the US. During the latter part of the course, students will create a
CGE model for a country of their choice (preferably their home country). This exercise will provide them with a basic model to examine the possible effects of
various changes in national policy. Interested students could continue this project as a potential thesis topic.
Evaluation: Students will be evaluated using problem sets and a paper based on their country-specific model. Prerequisites: Economics 251 or instructor consent.
Enrollment limit: 20. Course intended for CDE fellows, undergraduate enrollment limited and only with instructor permission.
Cost to student: none.

ENGL 11 George Eliot's Daniel Deronda
"Was she beautiful or not beautiful?" George Eliot's final novel Daniel Deronda quickly settles this question about its heroine posed by the book's very first line
(she's super hot). The novel itself, however, remains occupied with the kind of suspended judgment on display here, incapacities to decide-who to love, who one
is, what to do with one's life-that strike us, and struck Eliot, as the usual angst of the young and unattached, but also as the very condition of modern life (for
contemporary intertexts on both of these counts, see both "Gossip Girl" and "The Bourne Ultimatum" ). The only of her novels Eliot set in her own time, as well
as the only one really about London and urban life, Deronda is Eliot's most modern book, occupied with questions of art and experience, belonging and cosmo-
politanism, national and religious identity. At the same time, the occasionally melodramatic, supernatural tones that color some episodes-both the novel's hero
and its central bad dude seem to exert a kind of ESP mind control over its heroine, for example-can make it feel as if this book has been colonized by the novel
genre's supposedly outdated predecessor, the Romance. Daniel Deronda is a great read--immersive and strange--but also, like many nineteenth century novels,
long. So, we'll take up Winter Study's offer of the luxury of time to really read this one novel together over the month. To give us a few different grips on Deronda,
we'll likely also take a look at a bit of the best recent thinking in literary studies provoked by this book. For even more kicks, we'll watch a recent BBC film
adaptation of the novel that stars Hugh Dancy. We'll keep reading journals along the way.
Requirements: lively, thoughtful contributions to in-class discussion. You should also be committed to reading a big nineteenth-century novel over the WS term.
We'll keep reading journals that will be turned in for final evaluation.
No prerequisites; no prior experience with George Eliot necessary.. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to English majors.
Cost to student: about $20 for the book and copy costs.
Meeting time: mornings.

ENGL 12 Looking at Contemporary Documentary Photography (Same as ArtH 12 and Special 27)
This course explores the evolution of modern documentary photography. We will start with Robert Frank's The Americans, and how Frank's singular vision
deeply shaped the next generation of photographers working the American streets and landscape. Diane Arbus, Bruce Davidson, Lee Freidlander, William Klein,
Danny Lyon, Gary Winogrand are some of the photographers whose work we will get to know well. Discussions will include the new wave of independent and
Magnum photojournalists (Phillip Jones Griffiths, Josef Koudleka, Susan Meiselas, Gilles Peress, James Nachtwey, Alex Webb, Ron Haviv and Tyler Hicks) and
the wars from Vietnam to Bosnia to Iraq they cover as well as the personal visions they explore. Insight into the diverse currents of documentary photography will
be covered through the work of Bill Burke, Larry Clark, Larry Fink, Nan Goldin, Emmet Gowin, Sally Mann, Mary Ellen Mark, Nicholas Nixon , Richard
Misrach, Joel Sternfeld, Edward Burtynsky, Laura Letinsky and Simon Norfolk.
The class will meet three mornings a week for two hours. Slide presentations will occupy half of the first meetings and give way to discussion of isssues in
documentary photography. Students will be encouraged to work on individual projects of their own choice. Each student will be required to make a brief presenta-
tion to the class on a documentary topic of their choice. A final paper expanding on this documentary topic will be due at the end of the course. Students will be
evaluated on their classroom presentation, general participation and their written work. A field trip to New York will let us see first hand works from the collec-
tions at the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art and the International Center of Photography.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 12. Preference given to upperclass students.
Cost to student: $50.

ENGL 13 Obsession
In this class, we'll explore the phenomenon of obsession-mad, fixated desires: what prompts obsession, why it takes the forms it does, and what it can it tell us
about our relation to the things of the world. We'll start with some psychoanalytic material, particularly Freud and Lacan. Then we'll turn to literature, film, and
art. Works may include the paintings of Hieronymous Bosch, Poe's "Berenice," Balzac's "Eugenie Grandet," Dostoevski's "Notes from Underground," Thomas
Bernhard's "The Old Masters," Frears' "Dangerous Liaisons," Scorsesi's "Taxi Driver," Herzog's "Fitzcarraldo" -students will be encouraged to come up with
their own examples.
Evaluation will be based on participation in discussions, brief written reports, and a final critical project. (Ten pages of writing in all.)
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. If overenrolled, students will be selected for gender balance, balance of graduating years.
Cost to student: $25 for books.

PYE
ENGL 14 Language and "Voice" in Asian American Literature and Ordinary Language Philosophy
This course, conceived very much in the adventurous spirit of winter study, is an intellectual experiment. It draws together two important bodies of literature that,
as far I know, have never been studied together, in order to see what light each might cast on the other: Asian American literature, on the one hand, and Ordinary
Language Philosophy (or OLP) on the other. OLP is a philosophical method that is characterized by its detailed investigations of everyday language use (as
opposed, that is, to the construction of abstract theoretical systems). Major practitioners of OLP, like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Stanley Cavell, therefore eschew
the kind of systematic theorization that is typical of traditional philosophy in favor of nuanced and vivid descriptions of ordinary language use in everyday situa-
tions, which lend their writings an almost novelistic quality at times. One of OLP's basic goals is to understand what it means to be (as well as to become) a fluent
speaker of a given language, and so, writers like Cavell and Wittgenstein care deeply about things like the following: what it feels like to be a part of (and
sometimes to feel excluded from) a linguistic community; why we sometimes feel at home in our language, and why at other times we can feel estranged from our
own words, as if they really belonged to someone else; how deeply it matters that we be able to express ourselves both intelligibly and imaginatively to others (and
so also how painful it can feel to be unable, at times, to give our selves articulate expression); and finally, what it means to find (as well as to fail to find) one's
"voice," in every sense of that loaded term, from the most personal to the political. These are core concerns of OLP, but they also happen to be central concerns of
much Asian American literature as well, which has often focused on the linguistic journeys of characters, whether immigrants or the descendants of immigrants,
as they struggle (and not always successfully) to find "voices" of their own. Because both bodies of literature are so deeply concerned with language and voice,
my intuition is that we can learn some new and surprising things about both Asian American literature and OLP by studying the two in close conjunction. We will
spend about two-thirds of our time reading classic texts of Asian American literature by Carlos Bulosan, Maxine Hong Kingston, Frank Chin, Theresa Hak
Kyung Cha, Gish Jen, and Chang Rae Lee. And we will spend the rest of our time reading OLP texts by Wittgenstein and Cavell, as well as some excerpts from
the writings of influential Asian American literary critics like Elaine Kim and Lisa Lowe.
Evaluation will be based on a final 10-page paper.
No prerequisites (and no prior experience with philosophy will be assumed). Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: $50-75 for books.
Meeting time: afternoons., two-hour classes three times a week.

ENGL 15 Black Independent Cinema (Same as Africana Studies 15 and American Studies 17)
Trick question: Is black independent cinema (a) a marketing strategy, (b) a political project, or (c) an aesthetic tradition? In this course, we'll watch movies that are
celebrated or obscure, crowd-pleasing or aesthetically demanding, militant or reassuring, or sometimes all of the above. But "all of the above" is a lousy, lazy
321
answer to a trick question--the kind of thing you might say on the way out of the theater if you want to sound smart but don't really have an opinion of your own.
The films we watch are not designed for a passive, silent viewer, so one of our tasks will be to try to understand how we might constitute ourselves as the audience
these films call for. Filmmakers may include Charles Burnett, Julie Dash, Oscar Micheaux, Spike Lee, and others; requirements will include readings, written
responses (to be shared with your classmates), and class presentations.
Requirements: regular short writing and class presentations.

ENGL 16 Journalism
Acquaintance with the fundamentals of journalism is useful in dealing with the daily avalanche of news and information. An understanding of how news is
gathered and presented in print improves the health of skepticism, aids communication skills and sharpens the ability to think critically.
Assignments in this introductory course will include writing "basic" news stories, features, obituaries, editorials, op-ed pieces and reviews. Students also will
explore interviewing techniques, the cultivation and evaluation of sources and other aspects of a newspaper reporter's job. In addition to current daily newspapers,
magazines and on-line news sources, students will read and discuss examples of the journalistic forms under study.
Evaluation will rely on class attendance and participation and timely completion of all assignments.

ENGL 17 Virtual Realities
Your eyes scan the Winter Study course descriptions for 2010. You are reading them now. You stop at this one: "Virtual Realities....Students will read a series of
short stories on VR themes (artificial reality, metafiction, etc.) by authors like Philip K. Dick, Stanislaw Lem, Kelly Link, and Aramaki Yoshio, and then construct
their own simulacra or copies of the stories as a mode of commentary or criticism. In the first half of the course, these simulacra will be written texts: parodies,
meta-fictional criticism, or essays that reproduce the devices of the stories themselves. During these first two weeks we will also be learning to build simulations
in the massively multi-user online world called Second Life, and in the latter part of the course, the class will enter this world and construct a virtual playground
for a new kind criticism and a new kind of storytelling...." Oh God, you think, a virtual WSP. And yet critical analysis is already a type of virtual reality, a
superimposed landscape of interpretation. And here you are, a virtual adult leading an artificial life in a fairy tale college--how much simulation can one person
stand? Unless, unless, these competing distortions can compound or negate each other, and leave you grounded in a hyper-reality that is realer than real. No books,
no mechanical essays, no nothing (but still a significant amount of interesting, challenging work). By the end, maybe you won't even have to show up, except as
fake avatars in Second Life.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, preparation, 2-3 writing assignments, and a project in Second Life.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to students with a demonstrated interest in the material.
Cost to student: $40.
Meeting time: mornings, three times a week for 2-hour sessions (including some virtual meetings in Second Life itself), with additional reading, writing, and
Second Life lab work totaling 20 more hours each week.

ENGL 18 Making Pottery on the Potter's Wheel
Each class will begin with a lecture-demonstration, followed by practice on the potter's wheel. Each student will have the use of a potter's wheel for each class.
We will work with stoneware and porcelain clays on mugs, bowls, pitchers, plates, jars, lids, vases, and bottles, and will finish these shapes as required by trim-
ming and adding handles, lugs, lids, spouts, and knobs. We will also work on several different handbuilding projects. After the tenth class session, all class work
will be biscuit-fired. The eleventh class will be devoted to glazing the biscuited pieces. Glazing techniques will include pouring, dipping, layering, brushing, and
stamping, and using wax resist and other masking techniques to develop pattern and design. The completed work will then be glaze-fired. The last meeting will be
devoted to a "final project" gallery show of your best work. Woven into lecture-demonstrations will be presentations on various topics relating to the science and
history of pottery making.
Requirements: attendance at all class sessions and enthusiasm for learning the craft of pottery making.
No prerequisites or potterymaking experience necessary. Enrollment limit: 9. Preference will be given to English and Art majors.
Cost to student: $250 lab fee, plus makeup class fees ($42.00 per class) if applicable.

ENGL 27 Printmaking on Paper Clay (Same as ArtS 27)
This course introduces the technical and creative possibilities of printmaking on ceramic paperclay without the use of a press. Students will learn how to make
their own paperclay and will explore monoprinting, relief printing, and offset printing. Historical examples of printmaking on clay will be introduced and ex-
plored through lectures, examples and assignments. Students will receive feedback on their work through supervised group critiques and open studio sessions.
They will be evaluated based on completion of assignments with attention to content, detail, and development of their work. Attendance and participation are
required along with an exhibition of final work on the last day of Winter Study.
The goal of this course is to experiment with different printing methods on ceramic surfaces. You will learn about the history of printmaking on ceramics and use
that knowledge as a stepping stone for your individual projects. This course will cover basic handbuilding with clay, concentrating on surface design through
printmaking. Each of you will be expected to develop your own visual vocabulary and create objects in 2 and 3D formats. The exchange of ideas among class-
mates of different skill levels will be highly encouraged in the studio, as will the importance of exploring the work of contemporary artists. We will also draw from
various texts and web sites for historical and contemporary examples for discussion. You will learn about kiln firing and will complete projects by the end of the
course for exhibition.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8.
Cost to student: $35 for book (Image Transfer on Clay by Paul Andrew Wandless) plus $40 lab fee to cover cost of materials.

ENVI 14 Sustainable Agriculture: On The Farm
Understanding and getting involved in our food production chain is of growing interest to those with concerns about their own ecological footprint, maintaining
personal physical health, the humane treatment of animals, sustainable local economies, social justice or other issues. Sustainable agriculture comes in many
forms, reflective of the given ecological/economic/cultural/historic/personal context of a farm. To truly understand this most important issue, just like all matters
of ecology, we must go deeper than the overarching theories and find out what the relationships are on the ground.
Through class visits to local farms, reading and a reflective journal, students will gain hands-on experience exploring the day-to-day operations and guiding
principles of some local sustainable agricultural enterprises. While January is generally thought of as a time of reflection and planning on the farm, there is still
work to be done both outside and inside. Find out what goes on in a dairy enterprise, a mixed vegetable operation, a sugar bush, a woodlot, a pastured and foraging
mixed animal farm or an orchard during the "off-season". Meet the farmers, ask the questions, learn skills and lend your help to the task at hand. Because January
is the time of reflection and planning, we will join the farmers in a little reading and reflection of our own. Members of the class will engage in a brief survey of
agriculturally relevant literature including popular non-fiction, journals, newsletters and informational publications as suggested by the instructor and the farmers
visited. Students will respond to our experiences, discussions and readings in a reflective journal.
As per the field nature of this course, students will be responsible for dressing appropriately for January weather on a farm. Appropriate attire might include boots,
hat, gloves, coat, etc, that you're not afraid to get dirty.

ENVI 15 Williams' Sustainability and Student Engagement
Through readings and case studies, students will learn how models for creating change (politics and power, rules and organizational structure, and prosocial
norms and social marketing) can be applied to addressing the challenges of climate change. These models will be used to examine the role of student engagement
in the success of Williams College's sustainability initiatives. Students will learn about sustainability initiatives on campus and learn how they can be an effective
agent of change. Students will engage with one of three sustainability projects outlined by the course instructors. The projects will address one of three topics:
food and sustainability, energy and the built environment, and sustainable living.
Evaluation will be based on final project and presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20.
Cost to student: $50 for books/materials.
Meeting time: 10 a.m.-1 p.m., two times a week.

ENVI 25 Sustainable Tourism: Ecological Development in a Small Island Nation
The Island School (IS) and affiliated Cape Eleuthera Institute (CEI) are an ecologically-sound school and research center that integrate sustainability into every
part of their operations. New and innovative systems are continually being developed to allow the campus to grow with minimal impact on the surrounding
environment, and with a positive environmental impact on the surrounding communities. Systems such as biodiesel production, solar and wind energy, compost-
ing, farming, water collection, green building design, alternative septic systems, aquaponics and offshore aquaculture make the institution a model of sustainable
development in the Bahamas. The natural limits of the island environment provide a unique set of challenges and opportunities for the campus to achieve carbon
neutrality and zero-waste, and for the island as a whole to achieve the goal of Freedom 2030, an initiative of the Bahamas National Government for Eleuthera to
become energy independent and fossil-fuel free by 2030.
The location in the Bahamas offers students a unique opportunity to learn about the tropical terrestrial and marine environments as well. Understanding the local
environment is instructive as students explore the myriad ways that the campus seeks to integrate with the biologic community. In this course students will use the
campus and the island as a laboratory for the study of sustainable systems, including food, energy, water, materials, waste, and transportation. Students will
become intimately aware of where resources come from and will be challenged to investigate solutions to some of the ongoing resource issues at the school and
on the island.
Students will spend two weeks on Eleuthera and the third week at Williams. The first week will be an intensive course on the basics of sustainable systems (listed
above), through a mix of lectures, readings, classroom discussions, hands on investigation of campus systems, and site visits. In the second week the students will
apply what they have learned to a project on the island. The Bahamas government has decided that Eleuthera should be developed for ecotourism: currently,
much of the Island's coast is pristine and there is minimal tourism, coupled with a weak economy and high unemployment. Working in conjunction with the
Ministry of Tourism, and with the staff of the CEI, the students and I will work with an existing or planned resort to identify ways that is can operate in an
environmentally sustainable way. This will include measuring the planned or existing resource consumption, ecological impact, energy use, water use, imports,
impact on the land and coast line, food needs, waste production, and sewage. We will work as a research team; the project will result in a plan, a final report, and a
public presentation for the resort and the Ministry of Tourism. The third week of class will be spent back at Williams doing more research and data analysis,
finishing the report, and finalizing the public presentation, to be given on campus.
The CEI and the IS are the only research institutions on Eleuthera and their role as experts in renewable energy, sustainable systems, and resource management
have earned them high praise as advisors to government and business. Further, the CEI has close ties with the Ministry of Tourism and has previously worked
collaboratively. As the instructor, I will be assisted by two CEI researchers who will each give one lectures, as well as campus tours and explanations of the
campus systems, and who will serve as on-site advisors to the class. This arrangement is confirmed and incurs no additional costs to the class.
Students will be evaluated on their class work, work on the group projects, and participation in all research and project activities on Eleuthera. They will also

ENVI 26 Vermont's Northeast Kingdom: the 19th Century Meets the 21st Century
Less than four hours drive from Williamstown, the Northeast Kingdom is as different as a foreign country. The course will examine the geography, politics,
culture and environmental assets of Vermont's most remote region. For generations this sparsely populated area was home to a static, impoverished, self-reliant
Yankee rural culture based on farming and timber. At the end of the 1960's, the completion of the Interstate highway system brought the region into much closer
proximity to more developed areas namely Massachusetts. Today the region is changing rapidly generating a clash of cultures between the native Yankees and the
"flatlanders" and other people from "away". The course will examine competing visions for the future of the region as the old Yankee kerosene culture meets the
present day digital culture. It is envisioned that for many students from urban upbringings, this will be their first in-depth look at rural America.
The first week of the course will be spent on campus familiarizing students with this unique region thru reading novels of Howard Frank Moser--Northern
Borders, Where the Rivers Flow North, Disappearances, and Stranger in the Kingdom. Students will get a flavor of the culture thru reading websites such as the
Caledonian Record (the most prominent newspaper), Vermont Association of Snow Travelers (VAST--the statewide snowmobiling association), the Unorga-
nized Towns and Gores (UTG--the most remote towns without any town government), the Twelve Tribes of Island Pond, and the Vermont Traditions Coalition
(a "traditional use" anti-environmental group of hunters, fisherman, loggers, etc). The boom and bust history of the timber industry will be examined by reading
Tall Trees, Tough Men, the story of the cutting of the virgin timber, the lumber camps and log drives on the Connecticut River. The modern version of unsustain-
able logging by Champion International during the 1980's will be investigated with special emphasis on the outcome of the sale of 2 million acres of their timber-
land to conservation organizations.
In the second week the class will travel into the teeth of winter to stay at the Clyde River Hotel in Island Pond in the heart of the Kingdom. While there we will
meet with State Senator Vince Illizzi of Newport aka the King of the Kingdom; Jennifer Hanlon, supervisor of the Unorganized Towns and Gores; Mark Smith,
publisher of the Caledonian Record; Howard Frank Moser of Irasburg, novelist; Peter Schuman of Glover, founder and director of the Bread and Puppet Theater;
Jay Craven, filmmaker, founder and director of Kingdom County Productions; Plum Creek Timber Company, new owners of the Champion timberlands; the
Northeast Vermont Development Association which serves as the regional planning commission and
economic development authority; Steve McLeod of Bolton from the Vermont Traditions Coalition; representatives of UPC Wind, wind energy developers who
have been granted a permit to erect 14 large wind turbines on Hardscrabble Mountain; Walter Medwid, director of the Northwoods Stewardship Center in East
Charleston; representatives from Kingdom Trails in East Burke, a nationally recognized mountain biking and cross country skiing trail system; and the Twelve
Tribes of Island Pond.
The third week will involve a stay at Toad Hall, a legendary backcountry camp in East Haven built and owned by this instructor. Students will arrive on skis or
snowshoes with all their gear and food in backpacks. They will be involved in getting the camp systems up and running--heating the building with a wood stove,
chopping the ice out of the stream and hauling drinking water, melting snow for wash water. While in camp we will explore the backcountry on skis, learn about
wildlife track and tree identification, search for moose and examine other issues of winter ecology. The isolation and slow pace of life in camp will allow for
continued discussions of people and places we have visited. Students will be able to work on their final paper during this time. I will arrange a visit by a group of
thirty something young people to talk about growing up and living in the Kingdom. And of course camp life wouldn't be complete without the telling of tall tales
(of which I have many).
Students will be evaluated on attendance, class participation, the quality of journals kept and final project (ten page paper or other as approved by instructor).
Should the course be oversubscribed, preference will be given to students not from northern New England especially those from urban areas.
Enrollment limit: 8. Not open to first-year students.

GEOSCIENCES
GEOS 10 The Digital Darkroom
The camera is an imperfect tool. Film and digital sensors record only a fraction of the range of tones and colours the human eye can perceive, and today's monitors
and printers can display only a small portion of the information present in a well-exposed photograph. Digital processing is about optimizing the basic image for
electronic display or print.
The digital darkroom allows the photographer complete control over his or her images. This course will demystify its principles and practices by teaching the
basics of digital image manipulation and optimization.
Students will learn what makes a digital image, and how the tools they use affect the image data itself. They will learn about digital file formats and how to use
their camera's histogram to ensure that they capture the maximum amount of information from the scene in their viewfinder. They will also learn how to scan 35
mm slides and negatives for digital post-processing.
Using Photoshop, students will learn how to bring out the best in their images. This can range from simple tone and colour adjustments to complex layering and
masking to bring out hidden detail or to maximize the aesthetic nature of the print. They will learn how to remove dust and blemishes from their images. The
basics of digital printing and colour management will also be taught.
The students will produce a series of image pairs-processed images and their raw photo counterparts-which will be mounted on a class web page. Each student
will keep a journal recording the processes they applied and the results achieved.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation and journal quality and completeness.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to students: $30 for books. A digital camera (with RAW capture mode) is suggested, but students may use a 35-mm film camera, and bring prints or nega-
tives for digital processing, if they do not have a digital camera.
Meeting time: mornings for two hours, four times a week.

GEOS 12 Landscape Photography (Same as Environmental Studies 12)
This class will broaden students' appreciation for the appearance and history of the landscape and teach the skills of making a successful photograph. Williams-
town, situated in a valley between the Green and Taconic Mountains and bisected by the Green and Hoosic Rivers, is a place of great natural beauty. The local
landscape is a subject that inspires both professional and amateur photographers alike. While Williamstown will be the subject of most of our work, we will use it
to learn principles of universal application. Students will discover the importance of light in making a photograph. They will also learn camera skills and the
mechanics of photography to make slides, which will be reviewed at biweekly class meetings.
In addition to photographing and critiquing images, the class will visit collections at the Clark Art Institute and WCMA to see original work and examine and
discuss books on reserve at Sawyer Library. An overview of the history of landscape photography will be provided with an emphasis on American workers such
as Carlton Watkins, Eadweard Muybridge, Alfred Stieglitz, Eliot Porter and Ansel Adams. We will also demonstrate examples of different cameras such as
medium format, view cameras, and panorama cameras.
Students will produce a body of successful photographs/slides, which will be displayed at http://drm.williams.edu/projects/. Students will submit short written
explanations with each of their photographic assignments.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, the student's photography and their presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Priority given to first and second-year students.
Students will need a digital single lens reflex camera (DSLR).
Cost to student: approximately $50.
Meeting time: mornings.

GEOS 14 Geology of the National Parks (Same as Environmental Studies 14)
A vicarious trip through selected national parks of the U.S. and Canada with emphasis on the geological basis for their unique scenery. Areas to be studied will be
chosen in order to portray a wide variety of landscapes and geologic processes (volcanism, glaciations, etc.). Readings will include a paperback text (Plates and
Parks) as well as short publications of the U.S. Geological Survey and of various natural history associations. The second part of the month will involve indepen-
dent study of topics chosen by the students in preparation for half-hour oral presentations during the last week. The oral reports will be comprehensive, well
illustrated explanations of the geology of a particular national park or monument of the student's choice, using maps, slides, and reference materials available
within the department and on the internet. A detailed outline and an accompanying bibliography will be submitted at the time of the oral presentation.
Evaluation based on attendance and participation and on the quality of the final report.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference will be given to first-year students and others with no prior college-level study of physical geology.
Cost to student: approximately $60.
Meeting time: mornings.
WOBUS
GEOS 25 Monitoring a Coral Reef Complex
Participants will spend two weeks camping and conducting field work on St. John in the US Virgin Islands, preceded by preparatory time at Williams, and
followed by further time back at Williams carrying out data reduction and analysis. The aim of the course is to make a detailed map of the Mary Creek fringing
reef complex in the Virgin Islands National Park, and to track and interpret on-going changes in its ecology and sedimentology. In 1998 a group of Williams
students mapped the Mary Creek Reef Complex and discovered that large-scale transformation had occurred since previous mapping in 1968. A second group
mapped the reef in 2004, and showed that some ecological recovery was in progress. We will return in 2010 to continue this reef-monitoring project. Detailed
surveying and analysis of modifications that have occurred since 2004 will allow us to better understand this reef complex, and to put constraints on models for its
recent evolution in the context of tourism-based environmental pressure.
Evaluation will be based on participation in field mapping and on field notebooks.
Prerequisite: GEOS 253T in Fall 2009. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference to sophomores.
Cost to student: transportation, accommodation, and food will be covered by the College. Students must bring their own snorkel and mask.

GERM 25 Changing Vienna
For centuries, Vienna functioned as the center of a huge empire, stretching from today's Poland in the northeast to today's Spain in the southwest. Today, Vienna
has been called the capital of nowhere; Austria's somewhat bizarre and troubling trajectory preceding, during, and after the second World War has ultimately led
to its current status as a tiny, politically insignificant central European nation embedded in a rejuvenating Europe. But Vienna remains a fascinating place, laden,
but also energized, by its own history, and struggling to understand how that history informs its inevitable march into the future of a multicultural Europe. The
course will involve introductory readings and discussions in Williamstown, ten days in Vienna, and a follow-up in Williamstown that will include public presen-
tations of projects for which materials were gathered in Vienna. While in Vienna, students will visit the museum of the city of Vienna, the Jewish Museum, the
Archive of the Austrian Resistance, and various memorials around the city, as well as meeting with individuals and organizations associated with migration to
Austria from Eastern Europe, Turkey, and Africa, and relations to its remaining Jewish citizens.
Requirements: A journal kept during the trip, a five-page paper, and a public presentation.
Prerequisites: German 104 or equivalent proficiency. Enrollment limit: 8.
Costs to student: $1500.

HISTORY
HIST 10 "The Fatherland in Cleats": Soccer and Identities in the Americas
This course will examine the historical and cultural meanings of futebol/ftbol/soccer in inter-American contexts. Across the Americas people have used this
sport to define themselves, their regions, and even their national civilizations. Looking at both the darker tendencies (especially violence) and the aesthetically
pleasing products (such as Brazilian "football-art" or "the beautiful game") of soccer, we will discuss the boundaries involved in such definitions--between Latin
American countries and the United States, between men and women, between macho and non-macho men, between racial and ethnic groups. Among the ques-
tions we will address are: Why do nations develop allegedly distinct styles of play? Why has futebol achieved wide popular while soccer languishes in relative
obscurity? Will the rise of women's teams challenge futebol machismo?
Evaluation will be based on class participation, a presentation, and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference will be given to history majors and students with strong backgrounds in soccer.
Cost to student: about $50 for book and course packet.
Meeting time: mornings, twice per week, three hours per session.
KITTLESON
HIST 11 Waste
Waste, and what can be wasted, comes in many forms--some tangible (household, hazardous, human, industrial, nuclear) and some less so (time, money, effort,
opportunity, talent, words, lives). This course explores how understandings of waste and wastefulness have changed from the mid-1800s to the present, in the
contexts of developments in public health and hygiene, mass consumerism, and environmentalism. We will ask how waste and wastefulness have been con-
ceived, how these conceptions have shifted over time, and how they have been taken up not only in the scholarly literature but also in fiction. Assigned materials
will include theoretical works on waste; case studies about waste in various countries including France, England, the U.S., and Japan; and Don DeLillo's novel
Underworld.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and short response papers.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (decision based on discretion of instructor).
Cost to student: about $40 for books and course packet.
Meeting time: mornings; 2-3 sessions per week.

HIST 16 Genealogy
In this course, students will become familiar with the basic methodology of genealogical research and use this information to create a family history. Students will
conduct research using primary and secondary sources, including vital records (birth, marriage and death certificates), federal and state census records, immigra-
tion records, military service and pension records, naturalization records, probate and court records, newspapers, city directories, and published genealogies.
325
Students will index vital records in a community in Southern Bennington County Vermont to learn what information is included in the records and become
familiar with computerized databases. The course will include field trips to local libraries, local town clerks offices and the National Archives and Records
Administration in Pittsfield. Students will complete a family history using both secondary and primary sources. They will become familiar with the process of
historical research including formulating theories, finding evidence through various media (including oral interviews, records, ephemera, and published sources),
and drawing conclusions based on that research.
Evaluation: students will complete a family history from 1850 to present.
No prerequisites (although students should have some basic family knowledge, such as names and locations of grandparents in 1930). Enrollment limit: 18.
Cost to student: approximately $15.

HIST 17 The Fight for Free Speech in America
There is nothing free about free speech. Amendment to the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of the press, these rights exist only to the
extent that people are willing to fight for them. The war on terrorism and the USA Patriot Act pose the greatest threat to free speech since the Red Scare of the
1950s. But the censors are active in many other areas of American life: they challenge books in the public schools and seek to restrict the content of radio,
television and the Internet. This course will examine the battles that are currently being fought over sex and violence in the media, hate speech, the First Amend-
ment rights of students, and national security.
Evaluation will be based on regular attendance, class participation, and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 25 (chosen by seniority).
Cost to student: $50 for books and duplicating.

HIST 18 The Guitar in American Culture
This course will trace the history of the guitar, both acoustic and electric, in American culture. We will examine how the guitar developed in conjunction with the
history of American music as well as the music we imported from other cultures. The required readings and videos used in class will place the guitar in the social
and cultural contexts of various periods in American history and how guitars have changed with the development of sonic technology. In addition, we will visit a
local luthier to observe the process of how guitars are built.
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page paper and a final presentation.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30 (first come, first serve basis until enrollment limit is met).
Cost to student: $25 maximum for books.
Meeting time: afternoons, twice a week for 3 hours, 1:00-4:00.

HIST 20 1972-73
Roe v. Wade, the fall of Saigon, the Watergate hearings, and the Arab oil embargo, each of these occurred in 1973, and each one separately marked a major shift in
American politics and culture. Together these events also point to a period of cultural schizophrenia: the culmination of liberalism and the beginning of neocon-
servatism. The course will use documentary methodology--photographs, films, music, fiction, essays, and television--to identify and explore a series of themes
and issues that created the dissonance of the era.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and participation and a final project.

LEGAL STUDIES
LGST 13 United States Environmental Law: Its Historic Roots, Its Uncertain Future (Same as Environmental Studies 13)
Taught from the perspective of an experienced trial attorney, this course will examine the role environmental law plays in the United States today in light of how
that role has developed during the nearly forty years since the modern era of environmental law began. As a preface, we will consider the significantly more
limited influence of environmental law in our national affairs before 1970 and some of the historical and political reasons for that situation. We will examine the
reasons why the law's early application in the first half of the 20th century almost exclusively to the conservation and preservation of natural resources took on in
the second half a markedly different approach, one emphasizing pollution control and all but ignoring resource conservation.
This course will begin by tracing the development of an American consciousness towards the environment through an examination of our law and our literature.
The term "law" includes state and federal judicial decisions and legislation, particularly during the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt and during the decades
which followed the year 1970 when much of the legal basis for the American environmental protection movement was established. The term "literature" includes
not just the written word (the first book we look at is "The Lorax" by your favorite childhood author, Dr. Seuss) but also painting, sculpture, and music. Nothing
too heavy! We will examine the historical and legal choices we as Americans have made which have put our environment on trial. What has occurred in our
development as a people that explains this quintessentially American phenomenon? Our journey begins with the Puritans of New England and the planters of
Virginia and their predecessors in the New World and then moves swiftly to the beginning of the modern era in environmental law and to its now uncertain future.
In light of this historical situation students will examine state and federal legislative and judicial attempts to address environmental problems and then try to reach
informed, rational conclusions as to whether those attempts were successful. What were the political, social and economic issues involved and, ultimately, how
did their context affect the legal solutions imposed. Cases decided at the appellate level will be introduced and examined through their trial court memoranda
opinions in order to observe how the legal system actually works and how frequently the reasoning behind the trial judge's decision changes as the case works its
way through the appellate process.
This course will be presented from a litigator's point of view, that is to say, both the practical and the theoretical, emphasizing what is possible to achieve in the
litigator's real world as informed by what the academician would present from the security of the classroom. Evaluation will be based on attendance and class-
room participation. Students will prepare several short papers, including single page "clerk's notes," which will present one or more sides of an issue and form the
basis for classroom discussion. They will be asked to defend or reject the conclusions reached or approaches taken by our courts and legislatures and by our
literature, as broadly defined, on environmental issues.
No prerequisites. This course is appropriate for students eager to explore the material presented and prepared to argue assigned positions on important legal,
literary and historical issues. Enrollment limit: 12.
Cost to student: approximately $60 for books and materials.
Meeting time: mornings. 3 two-hour sessions a week.

LINGUISTICS
LING 10 Linguistic Typology and the Science of Constructed Languages
Saluton! Qapla'! Suilad! Coi! From Esperanto to Klingon, from Quenya to Lojban, linguaphiles have long been driven to duplicate and manipulate the properties
of natural languages to construct new languages for use in works of fiction, for facilitating international communication, or for the pure fun of intellectual stimula-
tion. In this course, students will develop their own constructed languages, guided by study of the cross-linguistic typology of patterns in phonetics, phonology,
morphology, syntax, semantics, and language change to help make their invented languages more realistic--or if appropriate, more realistically unrealistic! Stu-
dents will also apply their knowledge of linguistic typology to critcially assess the design of existing constructed languages such as Esperanto and Klingon.
Evaluation will be based upon class participation, performance on regular homework assignments, presentation of selected readings, and the quality and thor-
oughness of the final project, which will be a formal description and typological evaluation of grammar of the student's constructed language.
Prerequisites: Linguistics 100, Linguistics 210, or permission of the instructor. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference will be given based on demonstrated interest in
the course material and in linguistics generally. Interested students should contact the instructor in the fall with a brief expression of intent.
Cost to student: none.

MATHEMATICS and STATISTICS
MATH 10 LQWURGXFWLRQ WR FUBSWRJUDSKB
The ability to encode information so that only certain recipients can read it (or, conversely, to read information you are not supposed to have!) contains some of the
most exciting applications of pure and applied mathematics. Since at least the time of Julius Ceasar (the title to this course is encoded with the cipher he made
famous), codes and ciphers have been used to protect important information. We'll discuss various cryptosystems used over the years. The course will be a mix of
history and theory.
Evaluation: combination of paper/presentation and some challenge problems.
Prerequisites: Math 102 or its equivalent. Enrollment limit: 25.

MATH 11 Teaching Mathematics at BArT (Same as Special 17)
Do you have an interest in inspiring others to enjoy the intellectual triumphs of mathematical ideas? Is education one of your passions? Do you want to learn the
finer points of teaching while working with your own group of middle or high school students? This winter study course will offer you insights into the art of
teaching and will provide practical teaching experience in which you will be able to find your own voice in the classroom. In this experiential course, you will be
assigned to a group of middle school students from Berkshire Arts & Technology Charter Public School in Adams, Massachusetts (BArT) with whom you will
teach during January. You will meet with your students several times a week and will teach both the curriculum at hand as well as offer mathematical enrichment
and craft original activities. If you are drawn to the opportunity to teach real students and are willing to commit to this serious responsibility, this is the winter study
for you. Teaching is truly "the toughest job you'll ever love."
In addition to regular class meetings here on campus, Williams students will be responsible for meeting BArT students on their assigned days and times. Trans-
portation to and from Adams, MA will be provided. In addition to their teaching, Williams students will keep a Teaching Journal and produce a Teaching Portfo-
lio.
Prerequisites: This course is open to all Williams students having a solid knowledge of calculus. Enrollment limit: 8-10.
Cost to student: $25.
BURGER
MATH 12 Contemporary Movie Criticism
Are there some movies that you love? Are there any movies that you despise? If so, can you make it clear why you feel so strongly about a film? In this course,
students will watch the films of contemporary directors that have a very distinctive style--styles which they will either love or hate. The students will then study
how various critics have reacted to these directors, and then write their own responses. Directors that will be focused on include David Gordon Green, Larry
Clark, Terry Zwigoff, Kore-eda Hirokazu, P.T. Anderson, Errol Morris, and Todd Solondz. Students will be required to turn in and present several critical essays
throughout the term.
Evaluation will be based on a 2-page critical essay due every other class meeting.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: mornings, Monday-Friday, with two meetings at least two hours to show movies.
BOTTS
MATH 13 Atheism (Same as Religion 13)
In this course, we will read some of the recent authors arguing against a belief in God, including Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens, in
addition to some earlier writers. We will also read attempts to refute them. Discussion topics will include what role science has to play in determining spiritual
beliefs and potential foundations for morality when it is not dictated by fear of divine retribution. We will also debate the danger in having religious beliefs drive
political decision-making in a nuclear age. The validity of any and all religious beliefs and disbeliefs will be considered. Students who might take offense at
having their religious beliefs questioned should not take this course.
Evaluation will be based on participation in class discussion, leading class discussion and a 10-page paper. There will be a substantial amount of reading.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: $100 for books.
Meeting time: mornings, 6 hours per week, and a few evening sessions.
ADAMS
MATH 14 The Art and Science of Baking
This course will provide an introduction to baking, including cakes, meringues, cookies, pastry, quick breads, and chocolate. We will study the science behind the
baking in addition to techniques of baking. Students will also contribute to a food blog, where they will write about and display their creations.
Evaluation will be based on class participation (in the Williams College bakeshop in Paresky), homework, and a final project that will include both a baking and
writing component.
No prerequisites; the course is aimed at those without extensive baking experience, though some knowledge would be helpful. Enrollment limit: 10. Selection will
be based on responses to a questionnaire.
Cost to student: approximately $150 for textbook, ingredients, and supplies.
Meeting time: 2-5 pm (not Friday's), an average of three days per week.
PACELLI
MATH 15 Mathematics of the Rubik's Cube
The Rubik's cube, one of the greatest toys ever invented, hides deep and subtle mathematical concepts. In this course the students will learn how to solve the
Rubik's cube and will investigate the solution using abstract mathematics and geometric intuition. The mathematical model associated with the cube is the Ru-
bik's Group, an algebraic structure with more than 43 quintillion elements. We will study the basics of Group Theory, an area of algebra used in the study of
symmetry in two- and three-dimensional geometric figures. The mathematical theory will help us understand the beauty and some of the complexity of the
Rubik's cube. We will also briefly investigate the other Rubik's cubes: the 2x2x2 Mini Cube, the 4x4x4 Rubik's Revenge and the 5x5x5 Professor's Cube.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and homework.
Prerequisites: Mathematics 104 or its equivalent. Enrollment limit: 25.
Cost to student: $15 for Rubik's cube
Meeting time: mornings.
STOICIU
MATH 25 Graduate School Blog
Students will help in the launching of a blog for students enrolled in or considering graduate school. The first prototype <http://mathgradblog.williams.e-
du/>http://mathgradblog.williams.edu/ is one for mathematics, from which others may follow. The students will write columns, publicize the blog, and recruit
others for involvement.
In the travel portion of this Winter Study, students will attend the annual mathematics meetings in San Francisco January 13-16; write associated stories for blog
posting; and meet, recruit, and work with other students and mathematicians.
Enrollment limit: 4. Not open to first-year students.

MUSIC
MUS 10 Symphonic Winds
Students enrolled in Symphonic Winds will rehearse and prepare music in preparation for a February2010 concert performance. Students will participate in a
variety of performance settings from full ensemble to various chamber ensemble settings (both conducted and unconducted). Students will be responsible for
preparing their individual parts (including both instrumental practice and required listening/reading), attending all rehearsals and composer
lectures to which they are assigned by the instructor, and leading occasional sectionals. A specific, detailed schedule will be constructed once the repertoire is
determined; however, rehearsals/lectures will most likely be scheduled on Monday-Thursday afternoons and Sunday evenings. Students should be expected to be
in rehearsal for approximately 5-10 hours a week; for every hour of rehearsal time, students will be expected to have prepared for approximately 14 hours per
rehearsal, as necessary.
Evaluation will be based on individual performance and preparation, and, as necessary, written assignments. Repertoire will be selected based on enrollment.
Repertoire to be studied during Winter Study will include music of Louis Andriessen (De Materie, La Passione, and others), and possibly music by composers
including John Adams, Cornelis de Bondt, Susan Botti, John Corigliano, Michael Gordon, Judd Greenstein, David Maslanka, and Ileana Perez-Velazquez. Sym-
phonic Winds is open to students of all musical abilities, including wind, brass, and percussion players, as well as vocalists, string players, and pianists. Instructor
permission is necessary to enroll in this winter study course.
Preference is given to students who have performed in Symphonic Winds previously.
Enrollment limit: 30
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: afternoons.
S. BODNER
MUS 11 Words and Music by Bob Dylan (Same as English 19)
This course will offer students an opportunity for intensive study of the songs of Bob Dylan as we investigate in detail Dylan's lyrics and their musical setting and
performance. Albums receiving particular attention will include The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, The Times They Are A-Changin', Bringing It All Back Home,
Highway 61 Revisited, Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks, and "Love and Theft". Our primary focus will be on the songs themselves-on how they were put
together and on how we hear them-yet we will also consider the impact of social and artistic context on their creation. By studying these particular songs, we will
develop and refine our abilities to read and hear all forms of words and music. In addition to training our analytic and interpretive skills on Dylan's work, we will
also briefly consider figures who influenced Dylan and artists he inspired. Evaluation: Active participation in class discussions and one 12-page paper. Required
activities: This course will meet for two hours three times a week in the morning. Students are also required to complete reading/listening assignments before each
class meeting. Resources: The assigned listening will be available on a course web site to be activated by IT. (The website has already been created.) CDs, video
recordings, and books will be placed on reserve and these materials are already owned by Sawyer.
Prerequisites: none, although prior experience in literary and musical studies will enable students to engage more fully in the course's interpretive and analytical
work. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference given to English and Music majors or to applicants with demonstrated successful experience in related courses.
Cost to student: approximately $60 for books and photocopies.
Meeting time: The course will meet from 10 a.m. to noon on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday each week in room 30 of the Bernhard Music Center.
SHEPPARD
MUS 12 "Wherefore Art Thou?": Musical Explorations of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet
The story of star-crossed lovers is surely the Shakespearean story best established in popular culture. Besides the romance and tragedy which it first brings to
mind, the play Romeo and Juliet mixes low comedy, combat, songs, clowns, intrigue, and social commentary. Such a popular play has invited numerous and
diverse musical treatments for over two centuries, with composers seizing on various facets of the play according to their times and temperament. We will begin
with a reading of the play itself, and then examine diverse treatments of the narrative including the dramatic symphony by Berlioz; selected scenes from romantic
operas by Bellini, Gounod, and Delius; the orchestral overture by Tchaikovsky, the ballet by Prokofiev, incidental music by Duke Ellington, and the Broadway
musical West Side Story by Leonard Bernstein. We will also consider film adapations of the story, including the 1936 version directed by George Cukor and the
1996 film directed by Baz Luhrmann, with special attention to the cinematic use of music.
Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation; and a 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference to first-years and sophomores.
Cost to student: $20 reading packet.
Meeting time: three two-hour morning meetings per week.

MUS 13 Microtonal Eartraining, Performance and Composition
Instrumentalists, vocalists and composers are invited to explore the still new and growing field of microtonal music. The course begins with basic ear training--
hearing, singing and playing microintervals as small as 1/12 of a tone (n-note equal temperament), which will be of great value to all who perform and listen to
any kind of music. We continue with the creation of short compositional and improvisational exercises as presented in our textbook "Preliminary Studies in the
Virtual Pitch Continuum." Playing and discussing these exercises in class will provide an opportunity as a group to understand the esthetic and stylistic implica-
tions of using these strange new sonorities--a topic that often leads to more fundamental questions about what we expect from music. Students will be perfoming
their own or their classmates' short works by the end of the course. To put these pursuits in context, we will take a look at explorations with microtonality from the
turn of the twentieth century to the present--the music of Carrillo, Ives, Wyschnegradsky, Haba, Partch, Johnston, Boulez, Bancquart, Stahnke, Maneri and
others. By listening to recordings and studying scores, we will try to answer the basic question "Why microtones?"
Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: $50.
Meeting time: afternoons.

MUS 14 Soul of Jazz
"Jazz is the Teacher, Funk is the Preacher"James "Blood" Ulmer.
Exploring the music from the roots of the blues and gospel tradition we will take examples from various time periods and see how blues and expressive playing
has been interpreted since the earlier days of jazz through the present. Starting in New Orleans, up through Kansas City and Chicago and finally around the world
we will play, listen and analyze examples of the evolution of style and expression through jazz. Louis Armstrong, Louis Jordan, Les McCann, Horace Silver,
Charles Mingus, Lee Morgan, Cannonball Adderley, Eddie Harris, Herbie Hancock, The Crusaders, David Sanborn and beyond will be explored. Please note,
this class is for musicians. This will be an ensemble workshop playing experience. A performance will conclude the study session.
Enrollment limit: 8.
Cost to student: $50.

PHILOSOPHY
PHIL 10 The Philosophy of Chess
This is a rare opportunity to study chess with a Grandmaster. We will study the whole game, from the opening to the endgame. Students can expect to greatly
improve their chess playing skills, and to learn about the history, aesthetics and philosophical significance of chess.
329
Evaluation will be based on written analysis of games.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference based on chess level and chess interest.
Cost to student: $60-80.
Meeting time: mornings.

Gerrard is a professor of philosophy, an enthusiastic chess amateur, and was three times junior chess champion of West Virginia.
PHIL 11 Two Great Board Games: Chess and Go
Students will hone their skills in playing--after, if necessary (beginners welcome!), learning to play--arguably the greatest Western and Eastern board games,
i.e., respectively, chess and go. The chief philosophical subject matter for the course will be the differences between the two games. One such difference: whereas
chess pieces (chessmen!) are named for people having different occupations, and winning the game requires killing (or, at the bare minimum, being in a position
to kill) the opponent's pieces, go pieces are named what they are--stones--and although games generally involve removing some stones from the board, it is
possible to win without removing any of the opponent's stones. Outside-of-class may include some reading, but will include playing both games, with others on
campus and/or on computers, then either with others or against programs.
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page paper arguing either that one of the two games is superior to the other, or that they cannot be ranked with respect to which is
the better game (it is easily argued, for example, that both games are far better than tic-tac-toe; making that argument requires beginning to identify criteria for
ranking games in general.)
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference based on essay explaining interest in the course.
Cost to student: no more than $75, depending on whether or not student has chess or go equipment.
Meeting time: mornings.

PHIL 12 Ethics Bowl: Case-based Reasoning in Ethics
Ethics Bowl is a nationwide intercollegiate debate competition in which teams comprising three to five undergraduate students cooperatively develop, present,
and respond to analyses of fifteen morally complex case scenarios. In the national program, all teams receive the case descriptions in advance of the competition,
but they are not provided with any questions about them which they'll be asked to address during the tournament. Thus, teams must work through all facets of the
scenarios in order to be prepared for whatever the moderator and judges may ask. The competition proceeds, tournament style, as a series of matches in which two
teams square off in debating a question concerning the moral features of a given case. However, it is a debate with a difference: because teams do not know in
advance what will be asked, they are not obliged to take a position opposing that of their competitors. They may disagree or concur, but must provide an assess-
ment of their opponents' arguments and justification for their own conclusions. The emphasis in presentations is on substantive argumentation, not on rhetoric or
presentation style, and the positions presented typically represent a consensus among all the team members who have contributed to the preparations and analysis.
This winter study course will be modeled on the Intercollegiate Ethics Bowl format. It will begin with a brief introduction to reasoning in practical (as opposed to
theoretical) ethics and case analysis. Thereafter, students dive into this year's Ethics Bowl cases, some taken from the regional Ethics Bowl competition held in
the Fall and some from the upcoming national competition. The scenarios present ethical problems in one of a number of personal, professional, or public policy
domains (e.g., medical, legal, journalistic, and environmental ethics; issues of academic integrity, personal relationships, etc.) Students in the course will collabo-
rate in analyzing all of the cases in-depth, but will take primary responsibility for at least one and up to three cases. The discussion sessions will be intensive, but
very much student-driven, with the instructor acting as a coach rather than as a teacher.
The course will include at least one or two public "scrimmages" which may include teams from area schools (e.g., Dartmouth, Union). It is open both to members
and to nonmembers of the Williams College Ethics Bowl team. If the Williams College Ethics Bowl team qualifies to participate in the national IEB competi-
tion--as it has for all 5 of its years of existence to date--PHIL 12 students may be invited to join the "nationals" team. More information about Ethics Bowl,
including sample cases from previous competitions are available at http://ethics.iit.edu/eb/index.html.
Requirements: final paper (7-10 pp) based on an Ethics Bowl case of the student's choice.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15 (expected 5-10), priority to current Ethics Bowl team members and to juniors and seniors (any major).
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: flexible; generally, early afternoons.
J. PEDRONI
PHIL 13 God in Philosophy
Philosophers have been interested in God as long as there had been philosophy (and perhaps before). In this winter study, we will look at a broad selection of what
philosophers have had to say about God. We will look at ancient Greek attempts to characterize the nature of the divine. We will look at ingenious arguments for
God's existence as devised by Augustine, Anselm, Scotus, Aquinas and other medieval thinkers. We will consider the Fool's reply, Pascal's Wager, miracles, and
the problem of evil. Throughout the course we will be particularly interested to understand and analyze arguments concerning God. To enrich our discussions, we
will screen a selection of films such as Crimes and Misdemeanors, Religulous, and Faustina.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation, and short written assignments totaling to no more than 10 pages.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Meeting times: 3 meetings a week and film screenings.
MCKEEN
Catherine McKeen is a visiting scholar at Williams College. McKeen holds a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Rutgers University and has taught at Clark University,
Williams College, and SUNY College at Brockport.
PHIL 14 The Art of Ingmar Bergman (Same as English 20 and Theatre 14)
Ingmar Bergman (1918-2007) was one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. His films could be seen as a realization of Wagner's ambition to create a "total
work of art": they are brilliantly written, superbly acted and directed, with stunning photography and camera work, and all deeply indebted to Bergman's lifelong
preoccupation with classical music. In telling stories of varied complexity, Bergman expresses and explores--with considerable psychological sophistication and
sometimes with humor--human emotions, relationships and solitude, the meaning of life and the role of art in it.
We will analyze and discuss Bergman's evolving filmmaking technique, his aesthetics, and his philosophical preoccupations. We will read his screenplays,his
memoir The Magic Lantern, and select critical responses to his work--including Bergman's own mature self-evaluation.
The focus of the course will be on a necessarily small selection of Bergman's films. Time permitting, we will see Smiles of a Summer Night, Seventh Seal, Wild
Strawberries, Through a Glass Darkly, Persona, Cries and Whispers, Face to Face, Scenes from a Marriage, and Sarabande. The last week will be devoted to
viewing and discussing of Bergman's masterpiece, Fanny and Alexander.
Format: seminar
Requirements: class attendance and participation; weekly short papers (about 1000 words each); and a final paper, about 5 pages long.
No prerequisites. Enrollment: limit: 20. In case of overenrollment, preference will be given to students who demonstrate a strong interest in the course.
Cost to student: $20-40 for the reading packet and/or books.
Class meetings will be in the afternoons, 3-4 times a week; film screenings, followed by discussions, will be in the evenings, 4 times a week, typically 7-10 pm.;
only students willing to devote evening time to the class should apply.
MLADENOVIC
PHIL 25 Morocco (Same as English 25 and International Studies 25)
Students in this course will spend winter study in Morocco. Morocco presents a compelling blend of historical influences and modern world currents. Threads of
Islam, Arab traditions, and the heritage of the native Berber people are woven into a distinctive cultural tapestry, while traces of French colonialism can still be
seen in the political and social structure. Morocco is at the intersection of the West, the Middle East, and Africa. Travel there is therefore a powerful way to
introduce intellectual themes that require and reward a subtle blending of insight from history, political science, religion, and philosophy.
We will take the first steps in engaging some of these challenging topics in order to enable independent study facilitated by serious and multifaceted exposure to
the country. For the first two weeks, students will study at the Center for Cross Cultural Learning (CCCL) in Rabat, taking Arabic lessons (classical or Moroccan
dialect) each morning and then gathering for lectures by local university faculty in the afternoon. During this span students will live with Moroccan families in the
Rabat medina. In the third week of the course students will travel in the interior of Morocco, exploring Fez and Marrakech, riding camels in the desert, and hiking
through Berber villages in the Atlas Mountains.
Students will be expected to attend all seminars, lead a group presentation, and complete a substantial research paper (10-15 pages). The presentation and research
paper will be occasions to explore a special topic in depth including, for instance, justice and gender, art, literature, colonial studies, or Islam.
330
No prerequisites. Arabic is the official spoken language of Morocco, and French is spoken very widely. While desirable, neither is required. Enrollment limit: 12.
Not open to first-year students. Preference: Student interest is more important than class year or academic major. Final participants will be chosen on the basis of
interviews regarding student goals and intellectual interests.
Estimated cost: $3500.

PHYSICS
PHYS 10 Light and Holography
This course will examine the art and science of holography. It will introduce modern optics at a level appropriate for a non-science major, giving the necessary
theoretical background in lectures and discussion. Demonstrations will be presented and students will make several kinds of holograms in the lab. Thanks to a
grant from the National Science Foundation, we have 7 well-equipped holography darkrooms available for student use.
Students will be evaluated on the basis of regular attendance, completion of 4 laboratory exercises, and a holography laboratory project or a 10-page paper.
Attendance at all classes and labs is required for a passing grade.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 30. Preference will be given to students with no previous college course in physics more advanced than Physics 109.
Cost to student: about $50 for holographic film, chemicals, and photocopies.
Meeting time: At the beginning of WSP, the class will meet for lecture and discussion three mornings a week and for lab 2 afternoons a week. Later classes will be
mainly laboratory.

PHYS 12 Meet the Right Side of Your Brain: Drawing as a Learnable Skill
Representational drawing is not merely a gift of birth or a magical ability, but a learnable skill. If you ever wanted to draw, but doubted you had the ability or
believed you could not learn, then this course is for you. This intensive course utilizes discoveries in brain research to teach representational drawing. By using
simple techniques and extensive exercises you will discover and develop the perceptual shift from your symbol based left hemisphere to your visually based right
hemisphere. This cognitive shift enables you to accurately see and realistically represent the physical world. You will learn to draw a convincing portrait, self-por-
trait, and still life. This course is designed to develop your powers of observation and enhance your innate creative problem solving abilities, which are applicable
in any field. Students need no previous artistic experience, just the willingness and desire to learn a new skill. Students will be expected to attend and participate in
all sessions. They will also be required to keep a sketchbook recording their progress and complete a final project.
Evaluation will be based on participation, effort, and development. There will be an exhibition of coursework on the final day of Winter Study.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference given to juniors and seniors.
Cost to student: cost of text and approximately $15 for drawing materials.
Meeting time: mornings, two times per week with substantial additional independent student work.

Stella Ehrich holds an M.F.A. in painting from Bennington College. She teaches drawing at Bennington and other local colleges. She has had solo exhibits
from Rutland, VT to Dallas, Texas to Mobile, Alabama.
PHYS 13 Scientific Computing and Visualization
Students in this course will learn a number of computational tools and techniques to model and visualize scientific processes. Each student will carry out a series
of computational exercises using Mathematica, matlab, Python, C, Fortran, and/or a computer language of the student's choice (no previous programming experi-
ence is required). These exercises will be drawn from mathematics, chemistry, biology, and physics. In addition, students will be introduced to the typesetting
program LaTeX, allowing for the preparation of professional scientific documents incorporating high-quality images. An effort will be made to allow each stu-
dent to work on problems appropriate to his or her interests and background.
Students will be evaluated on the basis of regular attendance, completion of the exercises, and a final project or Cost to student: approximately $50.
The class will meet three times a week (two hours each), including a short lecture and group programming exercises; the final project will be planned and com-
pleted outside of class (estimated 20 hours each week).

POLITICAL ECONOMY
POEC 21 Fieldwork in Public Affairs and Private Non-Profits (Same as Political Science 21)
(See under PSCI 21 for full description.)
POEC 22 Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (Same as Economics 22)
Students learn about tax policy toward low-income families in the United States through training and work as IRS certified volunteer income tax preparers in
North Adams. This course has three objectives: 1) to help students understand the shift of redistributive policy in the United States from income support through
the transfer system (Aid to Families with Dependent Children/Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) towards support of working individuals through the tax
system (primarily the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC); 2) for students to understand the challenges that low-income individuals have "making ends meet" and
the role the EITC has played in increasing the standard of living of the "working poor"; and 3) To enable students to understand the tax code well enough to
prepare simple income tax returns including those filers claiming the EITC. Students will be trained by the IRS.
Evaluation is based on the results of the IRS certification test and the students' work as tax preparers. In exceptional cases, students will be able to write a 10-page
paper in lieu of these requirements.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. If overenrolled, students selected via a written statement of interest.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: TWR 10-12; Williams provides access to desktop computers via OIT and the Office of Experiential Education, as well as vans to the site in North
Adams for tax preparation sessions. Sessions are usually Thursday evenings and Saturday mornings.

POEC 23 Institutional Investment
This course is an internship with the Williams College Investment Office in Boston. It is part of a structured program designed to give students an overview of
endowment and investment management. Students will gain a better understanding of investments as well as sharpen professional skills that could be applied in
the investment or financial sector, either in the for-profit or non-profit realm. Topics include portfolio construction, endowment investment management, and how
the endowment supports the College.

POEC 25 Eye Care and Culture on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua
Continuing the model of recent eye care winter studies in Nicaragua, the trip will follow a similar protocol. In cooperation with Ray Hooker, President of FAD-
CANIC (The Foundation for the Autonomy and Development of the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua) who has assisted us in all of our previous courses and certain
professors of the New England College of Optometry (specifically Dr. Bruce Moore, Dr. Nicole Quinn and Dr. Elise Harb) who have previously trained our
students in the prescription of reading and distance glasses and have accompanied our trips, we are proposing a follow up course continuing our work of prescrib-
ing glasses and also the training of local medical personnel to prescribe and distribute glasses as a sustaining project. In preparation for this proposed trip, at the
conclusion of our 2007 trips, we left approximately 500 pairs of glasses and other materials and supplies in Pearl Lagoon for future work. After a partial week of
classes on campus on the culture and politics of Nicaragua and a weekend of training in the prescribing of glasses we would travel to Managua for a day of
cultural visits (national museum, Masaya Volcano, Huembes market). Following our cultural visits we would travel to Rama by bus and conduct clinics at this
important river port for a couple of days and then travel by boat to Pearl Lagoon. While conducting clinics in Pearl Lagoon we would send out small groups to
several communities on the rim of the Lagoon. While in Pearl Lagoon we will evaluate the work of the nurses we trained during the last two years and continue to
upgrade, expand and support this effort toward sustainability. After our efforts in the Pearl Lagoon we will travel to Bluefields by boat and conduct clinics at the
Normal School, the University and possibly the Cuban Clinic, where we have been invited to use their excellent space for exams. After our work on the Coast we
will fly to Managua and then to the U.S. The course will conclude at Williams with the turning in of our journals as well as discussions and evaluations of our
insights about the developing world and our personal reactions to the experience.
Enrollment limit: 12. Not open to first-year students.
Cost to student: $2500.

POLITICAL SCIENCE
PSCI 10 War in American Cinema
War is one of the most puzzling and enduring of collective human activities. It is also one of the most represented: stories of war have been told throughout human
history and can be found in poetry, song, literature, and more recently, on film. Not only has war been portrayed in multiple mediums, narratives of violence have
also evoked varied themes including glory and tragedy, sacrifice and suffering, heroism and recklessness. This course examines the aesthetics of violence by
examining portrayals of war in American cinema. How has Hollywood imagined war? What themes do American films emphasize and how have these themes
changed over time? How have war movies dealt with contentious social issues such as race, gender and class? We will explore these themes by comparing and
contrasting historical descriptions of war with their cinematic counterparts. The class will meet for two-hour sessions, three times a week for discussion and
in-class screenings (note: some films will run slightly over the allotted time).
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page critical analysis of a film of the student's choosing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference to Political Science majors.
Cost to student: approximately $50 for books and reader.
Meeting time: afternoons.

PSCI 12 Making Sense of the CIA (Same as Leadership Studies 12)
This course examines the history of the Central Intelligence Agency. We will examine some of the crucial cases of success and failure that mark the history of the
agency. While we will certainly look at questions of organizational structure and larger political context, our primary focus will be to examine the CIA through the
personal experiences of those who served in the agency.
Evaluation will be based on attendance and participation in class discussions, a short paper and a final 10-page paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference to Political Science majors and Leadership Studies concentrators.
Cost to student: approximately $50 for reading materials.
Meeting time: mornings.

PSCI 13 The Third World City
In 2007, the world became majority urban. But most of these urbanites live not in places like New York or Tokyo but rather in places like Lagos or Mumbai,
dwelling in shantytowns and working in petty commerce. Their cities' path of urbanization diverges from the "normal" one accompanying industrialization in the
West and East Asia. Toward this phenomenon, arguably the most important social fact in today's world, writers have adopted wildly divergent stances, from the
optimistic to the apocalyptic. We read a few of these, including Mike Davis, Rem Koolhaas, Sukhetu Mehta, Hernando De Soto, and Robert Neuwirth, and watch
some films and videos on the subject.
Evaluation will be based on class participation and a 10-page paper.

PSCI 14 The Federal Bench
As a branch of the national government, the federal courts are an important component of the constitutional political system in the United States, and they play a
central role in today's political debates. The past decades have been complex and fascinating ones for anyone interested in the federal courts. The class will
examine the allocation of authority among the branches of the federal government and the relationships among state, federal, and tribal governments within the
United States. Questions of the meaning of national and of state "sovereignty" lace the materials. Beneath the sometimes dry discussions of jurisdictional rules
and doctrines of comity lie conflicts about such issues as race, religion, the beginning and end of life, abortion, Indian tribal rights, and gender equality. In addi-
tional to considering the political and historical context of the doctrinal developments, the class will examine the institutional structures that have evolved in the
federal courts; questions about the size and shape of the federal courts, the allocation of work among state, tribal, and federal courts and among the different kinds
of federal judges now in the federal system; and the effects of social and demographic categories on the processes of federal adjudication. The class will also have
weekly discussion with members of the federal bench: Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Federal Circuit Judges and Federal District Judges in a roundtable
seminar discussion or lecturers.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation and a 10-paper final paper with presentation.

PSCI 15 Catholic Political Economy (Same as Religion 15)
The Catholic Church has from her beginning thought and taught on social, political and economic relations (e.g. St. Paul's Epistle to Philemon). Over the last
century or so, however, she has devoted particular attention to the problems of modern economies--inequality, class conflict, private property, the profit motive,
the welfare state, consumerism, and human freedom to name just a few--and wrestled with many foundational questions of modern economic life: What is the
proper relationship between the social classes? What are the merits and flaws of socialism? Of capitalism? Is love a relevant concept in political and economic
analysis? What is an economy for?
This course involves a thoughtful engagement with one small portion of the larger body of thought known as 'Catholic social teaching,' namely that emphasizing
the themes of political economy. Our primary texts will be the papal encyclicals Rerum novarum (1891), Quadragesimo anno (1931), Mater et magistra (1961),
Laborem exercens (1981) and Centesimus annus (1991), as well as commentaries on the documents themselves and their social impact.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, participation and a final paper.
No prerequisites, although a basic familiarity with general Christian history and doctrine is recommended. Enrollment limit: 15 Preference to Political Science

PSCI 16 Education for Liberation: An Introduction to Social Justice Education (Same as American Studies 16 and Women's and Gender
Studies 16)
This course is an invitation to engage in Social Justice Education, an interdisciplinary field of study that seeks to understand the power dynamics of the United
States in order to more fully work towards the ideals of equality and opportunity for all. We will spend time learning about oppression and liberation theories and
studying different manifestations of oppressions, including racism, sexism, gender identity, classism, ableism, heterosexism, and anti-Semitism. Investigations
into these topics will include academic scholarship, experiential activities, dialogue, personal reflection, independent research, and a final project. Students must
be open to a personal, dyanmic, and engaged educational experience.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, response papers, and a final project.
Prerequisites: American Studies 201, Women's and Gender Studies 101, or permission of instructor. Enrollment limit: 16.

PSCI 19 Global Political Economy: Current Events and International Public Policy
This course provides an opportunity to research and debate public policy issues in global political economy to understand better the practitioner's perspective. The
focus this year will be international government responses to the international economic crisis. Using current events and case studies about current global capital
markets dislocations, we will attempt to understand how warning signals were overlooked and assess the impact of this stress on the solvency of the financial
system and sovereign nations. We will try to look behind the headlines to develop a framework for mapping and monitoring evidence of any breakdown in
multilateral cooperation--what some call de-globalization. The class will then form teams to research critical issues affecting a region of personal interest and
recommend government policy actions to address the impact of the crisis. The course will culminate in a presentation of findings to specialists at multilateral
agencies, non-governmental organizations and the international legal community for a reality test.
Evaluation will be based on class attendance and participation in group project teams as well as the quality of the final presentation.
We will meet twice weekly for two three hour sessions. Students will establish a blog with the instructor and project mentors off campus. Significant group project
work will take place outside class. A trip to New York or Washington to meet subject matter experts and present findings will take place at the end of the course.

PSCI 20 Pictures and Words: Documentary Storytelling (Same as ArtS 20 and American Studies 20)
This course will explore the documentary form as a way to investigate and communicate compelling stories about social, economic and political life in the US.
Students will learn about the history of the documentary form through lectures, slide shows and screenings and they will complete their own documentary pro-
jects in class. The class will survey a range of projects that document the human condition by photographers, writers, and radio and film producers, including
James Agee and Walker Evans' WPA project Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, Jim Goldberg's Rich and Poor, David Isay's The Sunshine Hotel, Milton Rogo-
vin' Lower West Side, Mary Ellen Mark's Streetwise, as well as the current journalistic audio and slide show projects regularly featured in The New York Times.
Students will learn how to research and scout interesting stories, how to conduct and record interviews, how to capture a narrative with the camera, and how to
edit their work into a cohesive final project. Students will be encouraged to explore topics that are locally relevant, such as the effects of deindustrialization on the
social and economic life of a community.
Students are required to bring their own camera to class--all formats are acceptable from inexpensive disposable to a digital or analogue. Students are also
encouraged to bring their own video camera or audio recorders if they have them in order to record interviews but audio recording equipment will be provided as
needed.
Evaluation will be based on the completion of documentary assignments and class presentation, with attention to content, effort, and development of the work.
Active participation in class sessions will also count toward the final assessment. Presentation of final projects on the last day of Winter Study is required. Super-
vised meetings to mentor individual projects will be arranged. In addition to the work conducted on their own, the class will meet together three times per week for
two and a half hour sessions.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16. If overenrolled, instructor will conduct short interviews with interested students.
Cost to student: $25-60 for development of film and purchase of any additional materials.

PSCI 21 Fieldwork in Public Affairs and Private Non-Profits (Same as Political Economy 21)
This course is a participant-observation experience in which students work full-time for a governmental agency, nongovernmental (including voluntary, activist,
and grassroots) organization, or for a political campaign. Students may find placements in government and nonprofit organizations in which their work involves
significant involvement with public issues. Examples include: town government offices; state or federal administrative offices (e.g., environmental agencies,
housing authorities); interest groups that lobby government (e.g., ACLU, NRA); nonprofit organizations such as service providers or think tanks (e.g., Habitat for
Humanity; Cato Institute); and grassroots, activist or community development organizations (e.g., Greenpeace or neighborhood association). In 2009, students
are especially encouraged to train and become certified IRS Volunteer Income Tax Preparers through a special section of the course. The instructors will work
with each student to arrange a placement; such arrangements must be made in advance of the Winter Term. Students should first make their own contacts with an
institution or agency. The instructors and members of the Political Science department are available to help students find placements, if necessary. Each student's
fieldwork mentor shall send a confirmation letter to the instructors verifying the placement and describing the nature of the work to be performed by the student.
Students will read a few short articles distributed at the beginning of Winter Term and must agree to keep a journal, maintain weekly contact with the instructors,
and write a final paper summarizing and reflecting upon the experience. A group meeting of all students will occur after winter study to discuss the experiences.
Requirements: 90 hours of fieldwork; satisfactory evaluation from the institutional sponsor; 10-page final paper or equivalent; participation in final meeting.
At the time of registration, interested students should send a resume and letter of interest to Paula Consolini.

PSYCHOLOGY
PSYC 10 Immortality Bites: Meaning and Metaphor in Vampire Mythology
This class will examine the representations of vampires in terms of both symbolism and socio-cultural context. How do portrayals of vampires reflect the hopes
and fears of their time and place? How are themes such as living a meaningful life, balancing our animal instincts with our moral values, and constraining or
333
releasing our sexuality played out in books, movies, and television shows about vampires? This class will focus on novels such as Interview with a Vampire and
Twilight, movies such as Nosferatu and The Lost Boys, and TV shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and True Blood.

PSYC 11 Community Screening for Alzheimer's Disease
This course will consider memory screening as a strategy to address the increasing prevalence and importance of early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in
Williamstown and surrounding communities. Through readings and class presentations/discussions, students will become familiar with research on the epide-
miology and underdiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, neuropsychological screening instruments for Alzheimer's disease, and the design and analysis of screen-
ing instruments. Students will learn how to administer and interpret neuropsychological instruments used to screen for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The class
will then design and conduct a community screening day for AD. This will include selecting appropriate screening instruments, selecting an appropriate venue,
raising community awareness of memory problems, and working with local community agencies to encourage individuals to participate in memory screening.
Following the screening day, each student will analyze the data collected on the screening day and submit a report.
Evaluation will be based upon class discussions and presentations, engagement in the design of the screening day, proficiency in learning to administer screen-
ing instruments, and the written report of the results of the screening day.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 16.
Cost to student: $50.
Meeting time: the class will meet approximately 6 hours per week. Meeting will typically be in the morning. Some of these meetings will be as a class and other
meetings will be in smaller groups. Students will be expected to visit The Memory Clinic in Bennington, Vermont (20 minute drive) to observe the administra-
tion of screening tests and to become familiar with individuals experiencing memory problems.

PSYC 13 Animal Personality: Theory and Research
Over the past decade researchers have begun to make the controversial case that the same personality trait profiles which diffentiate between humans are also
present in apes, monkeys, dolphins, dogs, parrots, octopuses, hyenas, and other non-human animals. If correct, this raises many other fascinating questions: What
are animal personality traits "for"? Does environment shape animal personalities? Do animals have personalities in a more limited sense than do humans? We will
briefly review human personality theory and research before exploring the animal personality literature and its critics. In class we will interact with animals,
interview animal caretakers, and explore our assumptions about animal behavior. Animals will be present at class meetings and there will be field trips to a local
farm, veterinary clinic, and/or animal shelter during the scheduled class hour. Weekly time commitment will include six hours of class meetings per week,
approximately 5 hours of reading and self-scheduled film viewing, and five more hours divided among interviewing pet owners, writing brief reaction papers, and
developing a term paper.
Evaluation will be based on 1-page reaction papers twice per week, participation during class, and a 10-page minimum term paper on an approved topic related to
the course.

PSYC 19 Psychology in Action
This course gives students two opportunities do to a full-time placement during winter study either in a hospital, mental health or social service agency, legal firm,
industry, consulting, or research setting in which work of a psychological nature is done, or in a classroom at Mt. Greylock Regional High School or at Williams-
town Elementary School. For the former, during the fall semester, students are responsible for locating their own potential placements and consulting with the
course instructor about the suitability of the placement before the winter study registration period. Students should provide the course instructor with a brief
description of the proposed placement, noting its relevance to psychology, and the name of the agency supervisor. Before Thanksgiving break, the student must
provide a letter from the agency supervisor which describes the agency, and the student's role and responsibilities during winter study. For the latter (school
334
placements), those accepted will work under the supervision of a regular member of the teaching staff and submit a report on their work at the end of the Winter
Study Period. This project involves a four-week commitment to full-time affiliation with the school. Before winter study registration, interested students should
consult with Professor Zaki, Bronfman 389. He will assist in arranging placements and monitor students' progress during the four-week period.
Evaluation will be based on a 10-page minimum final paper summarizing the student's experiences and reflections as drawn from a daily journal, and the supervi-
sor's evaluation.
Prerequisite: Approval of Professor Savitsky is required. Enrollment limit: number of places available at the two participating schools up to a total of 20 in both
placements.

REL 12 Create Your Life with Yoga
This class explores the multifarious yoga tradition to lay out resources and techniques you can use to create your life. By integrating textual studies and personal
practice, you take your place as a creative innovator employing the resources of yoga. Analysis of classic yoga texts from India provides a historical, cultural, and
philosophical background. Class discussions consider key yogic concepts and how they relate to contemporary life, and yoga practice sessions explore how these
themes play out, both on and off the yoga mat. Based on the powerful technology of Anusara Yoga, you learn how to create your own effective home practice. As
you gain familiarity with the basics of human anatomy and receive individualized attention on how to work with your particular body, your practice becomes even
more effective. Creatively interacting with the yoga tradition can facilitate greater physical accomplishment and ease, prompt explorations of ethical dilemmas
and philosophical questions, and reveal ways to reduce stress and optimize your energy. This class aims to provide an overview of the traditional and contempo-
rary dimensions of yoga, and to empower each participant to draw upon this tradition to manifest a fulfilling, life-enhancing personal yoga practice.
Required Texts: The Yoga Sutras, The Bhagavad Gita, Hatha Yoga Illustrated, and related articles.
Evaluation is based on attendance and participation in all classes and sessions, as well as a personal practice journal, a research bibliography and oral presentation,
and a final paper reflecting on the course.

REL 25 Explorations in Solidarity: a Meeting of Minds and Hearts in Nicaragua
This course will explore the lived realities of the hemisphere's second most impoverished nation, and the relevance of faith and religious community to the
continuing struggle for social justice. Students will reflect on these realities in the company of subsistence farmers, urban factory laborers, and leaders of grass-
roots organizations working for progressive social change. The effects of free trade policies (CAFTA and FTAA) in an increasingly globalized economy, natural
disasters, and the changeable attentions of the developed world will be explored, along with other influences--Christian, Marxist and neo-Liberal--on the mate-
rial and spiritual well-being of Nicaraguan people. In particular, the course will explore ways in which the paradigms of liberation theology and the base Christian
community movement have shaped some Nicaraguans' views of the economic system and the natural environment in which they live, and some of their tradi-
tional folkloric and contemporary artistic responses to it.
Nicaragua offers a unique lens through which to view the culture and influence of the U.S., as well as the daily struggles, the dignity, and the hope of some of the
hemisphere's most marginalized citizens. The experience of the course will include approximately ten days of living (with minimal amenities) with families in a
subsistence farming community. Students will also attend a number of Christian religious services, and take part in dialogues with communities in which libera-
tion theology shapes perspectives and daily choices. (The course is open to students of any religious background or no affiliation.) And for a portion of the course
we may be joined by Nicaraguan peers who are involved in youth empowerment movements or in the midst of university education. Travels in Nicaragua will be
organized by the staff of the Escuela Asociacin Kairos para la Formacin, an NGO that facilitates educational programs and fosters faith-based partnerships for
communities in North America and Nicaragua. Throughout, students will be invited to accompany our Nicaraguan hosts as they live their daily lives, and to
reflect on their own identities and assumptions as North Americans. The goal is to explore the relevance of religious community to the possibilities for restorative
justice, and to discover what it would mean to shape a relationship with the people of Nicaragua according to a paradigm of solidarity--in contrast to the more
familiar paradigms of charity and national self-interest.
The course will begin in Williamstown with several days of background reading (Nicaraguan history, liberation theology and current political and economic
reporting), writing, and orientation. Once in Nicaragua there will be daily reflection sessions, in preparation for which students will keep a detailed personal
journal. Other requirements include attendance at two orientation sessions during the latter weeks of the fall semester; participation in a group oral presentation to
the Williams community upon return; and a final 10-page paper. As in years past, in order to get the maximum benefit from the opportunity to live among the
Nicaraguans, the course will continue into the first 2 or 3 days of "Dead Week"; students will return to Williamstown on Monday, February 1.

Conversational knowledge of Spanish is, of course, helpful; but we will be accompanied by several translators who will help to to make the experience accessible
to non-Spanish speakers as well. Willingness to live in physically demanding situations is essential. By present estimates, the cost of the trip to each student
(including all food, lodging, round-trip travel between Williamstown and Managua, all in-country transportation and fees) will be approximately $3,200. Students
are individually responsible for the cost of travel to Williamstown at the beginning of WSP.
Enrollment limit: 10. Not open to first-year students.

RUSS 12T Nikolai Gogol's Petersburg Tales (Same as Comparative Literature 12)
This tutorial takes seriously Fyodor Dostoevsky's famous yet apocryphal statement, "We all came from under Gogol's `Overcoat,'" by investigating the cycle of
short stories in which Nikolai Gogol's world-famous tale "The Overcoat" first appeared. Initially published in the 1830s and1840s, the five stories that comprise
Gogol's Petersburg Tales--"Nevskii Prospect," "The Overcoat," "The Nose," "The Portrait," and "Diary of a Madman"--are considered among the most in-
fluential works of short fiction ever written and have provoked as many interpretations as there are critics in the almost two centuries since they first appeared.
While critics in Gogol's own day praised them for their heightened realism and biting social critique, later scholars have viewed the Petersburg Tales as precursors
of the grotesque, absurd, and postmodern in twentieth-century literature. For each tutorial meeting, students will read a single Petersburg Tale, as well as a selec-
tion of criticism from Gogol's own time to the present day. Our final tutorial meeting will be devoted to synthesizing the myriad meanings of the Petersburg Tales
and developing our own interpretation of what and how Gogol's stories mean in the early twenty-first century. Students will work in pairs, with one student
writing a 5-page paper for each tutorial meeting and the other critiquing her partner's work. Students with advanced proficiency in the Russian language (RUSS
251 or higher, or the equivalent) will read the Petersburg Tales in the original Russian, while those who do not know Russian will complete all readings in English
translation. Students will be evaluated on the basis of the papers they write and their critiques of their partner's work.
Prerequisites: at least one literature course. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference given to Russian majors, Comparative Literature majors, and Literary Studies ma-
jors.
Cost to student: no more than $20 for reading materials.
Meeting times: tutorial meetings will take place twice a week, to be arranged according to students' and the professor's schedules.
CASSIDAY
RUSS 13 Humane Medicine and the Medical Humanities
There is a growing awareness that the sciences and social sciences are only part of the necessary preparation for medical school and the life of a physician.
Although the humanities teach about the human condition, too often physicians and scientists fail to appreciate these disciplines. In the film The Dead Poets
Society, John Keating describes this well: "We don't read and write poetry because it is cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human
race. And the human race is filled with passion. Medicine, law, business, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance,
love, these are what we stay alive for." In this course, students will be introduced to the medical humanities and will develop a personalized template for
life-long enrichment. We will start with Mark Edmundson's short book, Why Read. Then we will read poetry by Keats, Blake, Shakespeare, Dylan Thomas,
Emily Dickinson, and physician-poets William Carlos Williams and George Bascom; fiction by George Eliot, Victor Hugo, Chekhov, Bulgakov and Updike;
illness narratives by Arthur Frank, Elyn Saks, J-D Bauby; and medical student essays, such as "The Soul of a Doctor." We will also watch several films, such as
Wit and A Walk to Beautiful.
The course will meet for two three-hour sessions per week. In addition, we will have two evening film sessions to introduce the field of "CineMedicine."
Method of evaluation: Students will create a personal canon that will be hosted on a course blog.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 20. Preference will be given to students interested in pursuing a career in medicine.
Cost to student: approximately $50 for books.
Meeting times: Monday and Thursday, 1:00-4:00 pm. Students who need to be at team practices during sessions should not apply.

RUSS 25 Williams in Georgia (Same as Special 25)
Williams has a unique program in the Republic of Georgia, which offers students the opportunity to engage in three-week-long internships in any field. Our
students have worked in the Georgian Parliament, helped in humanitarian relief organizations like Save the Children, interned in journalism at The Georgian
Times, taught unemployed women computer skills at The Rustavi Project, documented wildlife, studied with a Georgian sculptor, did rounds at the Institute of
Cardiology, and learned about transitional economies at the Georgian National Bank. In addition to working in their chosen fields, students experience Georgian
culture through museum visits, concerts, lectures, meetings with Georgian students, and excursions. Visit the sacred eleventh-century Cathedral of Sveti-tskhoveli
and the twentieth-century Stalin Museum, take the ancient Georgian Military Highway to ski in the Caucasus Range, see the birthplace of the wine grape in
Kakheti and the region where Jason sought the Golden Fleece. Participants are housed in pairs with English-speaking families in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital city. At
the end of the course students will write a 10-page paper assessing their internship experience.
Knowledge of Russian or Georgian is not required.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. Not open to first-year students.
Cost to student: approximately $2000.

THEATRE
THEA 10 Theatrical Lighting Design
This course presents an intensive study of the art and techniques of lighting design for the theatre. We will examine the controllable properties of light, including
angle, intensity, texture, color, and movement, and explore the process of building a lighting environment onstage that supports a specific, personal point of view
about a play. This artistic exploration will be coupled with a thorough study of the technical aspects of lighting for the stage, including the physics of light and
color; standard equipment in a basic stage lighting system; how to develop a set of abstract lighting ideas into a full light plot; and how to focus the light plot,
program lighting cues, and bring design concepts to fruition on the stage.
The class will meet as a group three times per week in the afternoons, with additional individual sessions scheduled to provide one-on-one training specific to
each student's particular interests. There will be at least one required field trip to see a performance or performances and meet the designers to discuss their work.
Evaluation will be based on thoughful and thorough class participation and successful completion of class projects.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 10. Preference to sophomores and juniors.

SPECIALS
SPEC 10 Quest for College: Early Awareness in Berkshire County Schools
Today's extremely competitive higher education market places significant pressure on students nationwide to start planning for college at an increasingly early
age while simultaneously demanding ever-higher standards of excellence for admission to top schools. "Early Awareness" initiatives aim to educate middle
school students as to what lies ahead on the college horizon, empowering them to make sound academic and extracurricular choices that will keep open a maxi-
mum of options. The first week of this course will be spent in the classroom, exploring and discussing problems and issues germane to the national trends towards
greater (and earlier) college-related pressures.
Students will respond to a series of readings dealing with such issues as tracking, paid test preparation and untimed testing, early decision, parental and peer
pressures, special interests, misrepresentation of information, independent counseling, and others. Class time will also be devoted to familiarizing students with
both the nuances of the college admission process, visiting other higher educational institutions in Berkshire County, and learning how to facilitate the early
awareness game, Quest for College. Students will spend the next two weeks visiting 10-12 Berkshire County middle classes, administering the game. If student
and community interest is sufficient, the course may culminate in a public presentation and open forum regarding early college awareness initiatives.
Evaluation will be based on completion of field work (school visits), organization and a final paper (approximately 10 pages) reflecting on a course-related issue
of the student's choosing.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 8. Preference given to a) students with prior experience working with middle school aged youth, b) students who can be
approved to operate college vehicles c) juniors and seniors. Interested students must consult with the instructor prior to registration.

SPEC 12 Art and Disability (Same as ArtS 19)
This course explores the importance of art in the lives of individuals with disabilities. Do individuals with disabilities experience greater benefit from experiences
in the arts than the general population and, if so, why? What is the benefit to the larger community when individuals with disabilities have opportunities to create
and exhibit their art? Is art by individuals with disabilities viewed through a different lens and if so, what is that consequence of that perception? Students will
study specific artists and artist movements that include individuals with disabilities and a range of program models. Students will read first-hand accounts by
artists with disabilities and texts from both art and education scholars that look at these issues. Students will also view documentaries and performance events. The
second half of this course will include a required fieldwork component, with students attending workshops offered through Community Access to the Arts, a local
nonprofit that runs visual and performing arts workshops for individuals with disabilities. Students will attend workshops, assist participants, and create art along-
side artists with disabilities. This class will meet three times a week for two-hour sessions, with extra time scheduled for fieldwork. The course will culminate with
a ten-page final paper and presentation that documents the individual student's fieldwork experience within the framework of the questions and issues raised in
the course readings and class discussions.

SPEC 13 Literary Journalism in Practice
What are the best ways to use long-form journalism to get at a subject? In this course, we'll explore ways to tell a story in depth, by using tactics and techniques
borrowed from fiction, academic disciplines, and the arts. Classwork will include a number of brief assignments to focus on specific elements--ways to physical-
ly describe something, overhearing and transcribing dialogue, conducting interviews, and finding the right tone of voice. During our meetings, we'll read and
critique each other's work to assess what works and what doesn't. We'll include regular readings from masters of nonfiction--ranging from early and overlooked
pioneers like Mark Twain and Jack London, through popular writers like Tom Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson, Ron Rosenbaum, and David Foster Wallace. Evalua-
tion: The final piece will be a minimun 10-page profile of a person or institution around campus that will go through several revisions.

This course will focus on learning how to write and perform songs in a contemporary style. Topics addressed will include song structure, how to create a lyric that
communicates, vocal and instrument presentation, recording and performing techniques, publicity for events, and today's music industry. This class will culmi-
nate in a public performance of material written during the course. To successfully pass this course, students are required to create, edit, perform, and possibly
record two original songs. These songs must be conceived during the course period (previously written material in not usable). Students will be guided to create
both music and lyrics. They may also be required to participate in a co-write session. One of these songs will be presented during the final performance, preferably
by the student. Attendance at classes, feedback sessions, and final presentation is mandatory. Please note: this class meets every day. A short writing assignment
will be passed in on the last day of class.
No prerequisites. Students with a musical background and the ability to play an instrument may be given preference, but anyone interested is encouraged to
register. (Bernice.Lewis@wililams.edu). Enrollment limit: 15.

SPEC 16 Peer Support/Counseling Skills Training
Are you the person your friends seek out for support? Good listening and communication skills are of benefit to anyone and for students interested in the helping
professions, in particular. This course will prepare you to be an active listener, to help others feel more comfortable with social, academic, and personal relation-
ships, to assist others in making decisions without giving advice, and to assess risk. You will learn how to communicate about sensitive issues and develop identity
in the helping role. Emphasis will be given to learning one's limits within a given situation, knowing when to refer to other resources, and what resources are
available to students. This course will teach you broadly applicable helping skills that you can apply in any interpersonal role such as Peer Health, Junior Advisor,
or Baxter Fellow.
We will meet twice a week for 3 hour sessions. This is an experiential training augmented by relevant readings and out of class assignments designed to deepen
your understanding and practice of communication and helping skills. Evaluation is based on participation, attendance, and the option of a 10-page or final
project.
Open to first-years, sophomores, and juniors. Enrollment limit: 16.

SPEC 18 Ernest Becker: The Denial of Death
This course introduces students to the thinking of Ernest Becker. In his Pulitzer Prize winning book, The Denial of Death, this American anthropologist synthe-
sized various strains of 20th Century psychoanalytical thought (Freud, Kierkegaard, Rank, etc.). He noted how we all arrive on earth aware of our lonely set-apart-
ness, our cosmic insignificance and the fact that one day we will die. Such pitiable, degrading circumstances generates such anxiety and fear that we deny and
repress the truth of their reality and compensate therefore by vying with one another, either individually or as members of a larger group, in order to prove that we
or our group are somehow special, better, more superior to others. We are obsessively engaged in trying to do something that entitles us to the admiration and
respect of our peers. It is vital our self-esteem. We do so in order to maintain the pretense that we are truly "somebody" in the cosmic scheme of things.
It is hoped that students will judge or reassess their career goals in light of whether they are passionate about their goals and whether such goals involve inspiring
or otherwise benefiting others or whether their choice arises from a need for self-esteem.
While we will concentrate on exploring The Denial of Death, we will read portions of other works: Tolstoy's Confession, Albom's Tuesdays With Morrie, etc.
Evaluation will be based on attendance, classroom participation and a 10-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15. Preference based on seniority.
Cost to student will be approximately $60 for books.

SPEC 19 Medical Apprenticeship
Firsthand experience is a critical component of the decision to enter the health professions. Through this apprenticeship, students can clarify their understanding
of the rewards and challenges that accompany the practice of all types of medicine. Apprenticeships are arranged in two distinct ways: some students live on
campus and are matched with a local practitioner, while others make independent arrangements to shadow a distant professional. The expectation is that each
student will observe some aspect of medicine for the better part of the day, five days per week. In recent years, students have shadowed physicians, veterinarians,
dentists, nurses, and public health experts.
A 5-page reflective paper is required, as is attendance (for those shadowing near campus) at three Tuesday evening programs. Students will meet from 6:30-8:30
p.m. over dinner to hear from invited speakers from the medical community as a stimulus to discussion about their apprenticeship experiences.
Prerequisites: Interested students must attend an information meeting in early October.
Local enrollment is limited by the number of available practitioners. Preference for placements will be given on the basis of seniority and demonstrated interest in
the health professions.
Cost to student: local apprenticeships: required vaccinations, local transportation and possibly lunches. Distant apprenticeships: costs will vary based upon loca-
tion.

SPEC 20 What Was Monet Thinking?--Understanding Art, for Non-Art Majors (Same as Comparative Literature 20)
This course will introduce non-majors to the ways in which artists see and understand paintings--by painting. Following a traditional method, students will create
a painting (subject matter of their choosing) using the basic elements of visual art: line, composition, color and value. Each of these elements of the painting
process will be presented simply and in clearly defined steps through the use of visuals, demonstrations, and exercises. Supplementing the painting periods, the
class will visit the Clark Museum to examine and discuss how the impressionist painters understood and worked with the same issues and challenges. Students
will begin to see paintings as artists do.
Evaluation will be based on the completion of one painting by the student as well as a written analysis of one painting from the Clark collection. The evaluation of
the student's painting will be based not on artistic merit but on the effort made and understanding gained. Because of the step-by-step methodology, class atten-
dance will be mandatory.

SPEC 21 The Psychology of the Workplace; a Field Study with Williams Alumni/Parents
Field experience is a critical component of the decision to enter a profession. Through this field study, students can clarify their understanding of the rewards and
challenges that accompany the practice of many different aspects within a profession, and understand the psychology of the workplace. Field placements are
arranged in two distinct ways: some students live on campus and are matched with a local professional, while others make independent arrangements to work
with a distant professional. The expectation is that each student will observe some aspect of the profession for the better part of the day, five days per week. It is
also expected that the teaching associate will assign a specific project to be completed within the three-and-a-half week duration of the course depending upon
appropriateness.
Participation in this winter study will require the student to quickly assess the work environment, make inferences about corporate culture, performance norms
and expectations, and to take initiative not only to learn from this experience, but also to contribute where and when appropriate. Understanding the dynamics
within a work environment is critical to success in any organization and this hands-on experience will illuminate lessons learned in the classroom. Upon comple-
tion of the winter study, it is expected that the student write a thorough report evaluating and interpreting the experience.
Method of evaluation: It is expected that students will complete assigned readings, keep a daily journal, and write a 5-page expository review and evaluation that
will become public record as a resource for other students. Finally, the student will be expected to create a 20-minute Powerpoint presentation on his/her experi-
ence due at the end of Winter Study. If possible the student will make a presentation to fellow students at some time during the spring semester.
Required activities and Meeting time: The expectation is that each student will be in the field to observe some aspect of the profession for the better part of the day,
five days per week. In addition to observation there may be an opportunity to work on distinct projects generated by the instructor depending upon appropriate-
ness.
Prerequisites: interested students must attend an information meeting in early October, and meet individually with John Noble to go over the details of their
placements. Preference for placements will be given on the basis of seniority and demonstrated interest in the profession of interest.
Enrollment is limited by the number of available teaching associates (maximum 20). Preference for placements will be given on the basis of seniority and demon-
strated interest in the profession of interest.
Meeting time: each student will be in the field to observe some aspect of the profession five days per week, at least 6 hours per day.
Cost to student: Local apprenticeships-local transportation. Distant apprenticeships-costs will vary based upon location, but are the responsibility of the student.
Teaching Associates (instructors): Williams College alumni and parents of current Williams students will be recruited to become instructors for this course. A
broad range of professions will be represented as the course develops. Alumni and parents will receive a training packet and individual orientations with the
course director in person or via telephone conference.

Sponsored by the Gaudino Scholar and the Gaudino Fund in 2008 and now again for 2009, this Winter Study travel course will allow a small group of students to
live in Portland, Maine for the month of January, where they will explore the impact of over thirty years of refugee resettlement in the 'whitest' of the United
States. Each student will live with a refugee family from one of the over two dozen countries represented by the refugee communities of Portland, and during her
or his home stay will encounter first-hand the issues confronting recent immigrants to the United States from Southeast Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe or Latin
America. Students will keep a daily journal to record their experiences working with their refugee family and the organizations that serve them. Students will be
exposed to such issues as race, ethnicity, and national identity; the interplay of public and private values; the wide variety of educational, health, governmental,
339
and religious agencies and providers serving refugee families; and how these services are perceived and received by family members. Students will meet weekly
with the course instructor to discuss how their experiences are going; they will also have a chance to meet with a group of refugee and international students at the
local community college, and with some State officials serving the multicultural communities. Students as a group will also have time in Maine at the beginning
of the program for an orientation session, and at the conclusion to share experiences with each other and write a short reflection paper..
No prerequisites. If student interest exceeds the enrollment limit, preference will be given to those students who demonstrate, in a short conversation with and
essay submitted to the instructor, their interest in experiential learning generally and the problems confronting recent immigrants to the United States specifically.

SPEC 29 Applied Data Analysis
One of the main drivers of success in the 21st century economy is ones ability to understand, utilize and interpret data. This class will help you develop a comfort
level around data, learn the software necessary to manipulate it, and put these skills to work on a substantive project. We will use the R programming language and
associated open source tools, by far the most powerful software environment for summarizing, graphing and modeling information. You will gather data, repli-
cate the results of a published academic paper (or similarly rigorous non-published study) and then extend those results in a non-trivial manner. Most students will
work in teams but solo projects will be permitted. Projects related to Williams are especially encouraged, e.g., sustainability, admissions, housing policy and so
on. Data for finance-related projects will be supplied.
Requirements: 10-page final paper.
No prerequisites. Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: none.
Meeting time: afternoons.

SPEC 39 "Composing a Life:" Finding Success and Balance in Life After Williams
To be at Williams you have learned to be a successful student, but how do you learn to be successful in life? How will you define success in both your career and
in your personal life? How will you achieve balance between the two? In short, what will constitute the "good life" for you? We borrow the concept of "compos-
ing a life" from Mary Catherine Bateson, as an apt metaphor for the ongoing process of defining success and balance in life. This course is designed: (1) To offer
college students an opportunity to examine and define their beliefs, values, and assumptions about their future personal and professional lives before entering the
"real" world; (2) To encourage students to gain a better understanding of how culture, ideology, and opportunity affect their life choices; (3) To provide an oppor-
tunity for students to consider different models of success and balance through "living cases" (in the form of guests from various professions and lifestyles); and
(4) To aid students in contemplating their career options through individual advising and introducing various career and life planning resources. Using selected
readings, cases, and guest speakers, we will explore both the public context of the workplace as well as the private context of individuals and their personal
relationships in determining life choices.
Requirements: regular attendance, class participation, field interview, and a 10-page final paper. Weekly assignments include cases and readings from a variety of
related fields, and some self-reflection exercises
No prerequisites. Questions about the course: please contact Michele Moeller Chandler at 458-8106 or michele.chandler2@verizon.net Enrollment limit: 15.
Cost to student: $40 lab fee for cases/reading materials.
Meeting time: mornings--two-hour classes three times a week

NOTE: Because no Williams student should ever have to choose between important religious, academic and athletic commitments, College policy provides for students who wish to participate in religious obser
vances that conflict with other obligations to make arrangements with their instructors to do so.
The policy, approved in 1984 by the faculty and trustees in compliance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, states that Any student who is unable, because of his or her religious beliefs, to
attend classes or to participate in any examination, study, or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from any such requirement, and shall be provided an opportunity to make up such
requirement which s/he may have missed because of such absence nowprovided, however, that such makeup examination or work shall not create an unreasonable burden upon the College. No
adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student" who makes use of this provision of college policy.
The faculty (including coaches) receive annual reminders of this policy, and are encouraged to work carefully with students in anticipating and resolving conflicts to their mutual satisfaction.
